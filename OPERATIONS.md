# Operations runbook

Operator-facing runbook for running the Model Project Constructor
pipeline in a live environment. Audience: whoever is on the hook when a
run fails or a pilot needs to be re-kicked. For the system design see
`docs/architecture-history/architecture-plan.md`; for diagnostic walkthroughs by
failure mode see `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.

---

## 1. Environment variables

Every secret and every deployment-variable parameter is read from the
environment via `OrchestratorSettings.from_env()` — see
`src/model_project_constructor/orchestrator/config.py`. There are no
hardcoded hosts, URLs, or credentials anywhere in the codebase. Copy
`.env.example` to `.env` and populate the values appropriate for your
deployment, then load it (e.g. via `python-dotenv`, direnv, or your
orchestration layer's secret injection) before running the pipeline.

| Variable | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MPC_HOST` | no | `gitlab` | `gitlab` or `github`. |
| `MPC_HOST_URL` | no | host-specific | `https://gitlab.com` or `https://api.github.com`. Override for self-hosted / enterprise instances. |
| `MPC_NAMESPACE` | no | host-specific (script-level) | Target group/org path where the Website Agent creates the project. **Must be a path, never a URL** — e.g. `rmsharp-modelpilot` or `data-science/model-drafts`, not `https://gitlab.com/rmsharp-modelpilot`. Rejected at config-load time (`ConfigError`) if it starts with `http://` or `https://`. |
| `GITLAB_TOKEN` | yes (if `MPC_HOST=gitlab` and live) | — | Personal access token with `api` scope and create-project permission on the target namespace. Printable ASCII only, no whitespace: a value ending in a carriage return (a CRLF `.env` file), line feed, tab or space is refused before any request (see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)). |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | yes (if `MPC_HOST=github` and live) | — | PAT with `repo` scope on the target owner/org. Same format rule as `GITLAB_TOKEN`. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | yes (when calling first-party Claude) | — | Required by any live interview and the Data Agent's QC generation when the provider is `anthropic` (the default). The intake web UI needs it only when its provider resolves to `anthropic`; selecting `bedrock` uses the AWS credential chain instead. |
| `MPC_CHECKPOINT_DIR` | no | `./.orchestrator/checkpoints` | Root for the `CheckpointStore`. Each run lands in a subdirectory named after its `run_id`. |
| `MPC_LOG_LEVEL` | no | `INFO` | Stdlib level name: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`. |
| `INTAKE_DB_PATH` | no | `./intake_sessions.db` | SQLite file for the intake web UI's live session state. Only read by the UI. |
| `INTAKE_LLM_PROVIDER` | no | `anthropic` (`DEFAULT_LLM_PROVIDER`) | LLM provider for the intake web UI. Any factory provider (`anthropic`, `bedrock`, `opencode`). An unknown value is rejected at app startup (`ValueError`). Only read by the UI; the CLIs use `--provider`. Neither non-default provider is validated — `bedrock` has never run live, `opencode` is unmeasured for quality. |
| `INTAKE_LLM_MODEL` | no | provider default | Model id for the intake web UI. When unset, each provider's own default model is used (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6` for `anthropic`, `anthropic.claude-opus-4-8` for `bedrock` — the mantle catalog has no Sonnet tier) — leave unset to keep the id provider-native. Only read by the UI. |
| `AWS_REGION` | yes (if `bedrock` and live) | — | Selects the `bedrock-mantle.{region}.api.aws` endpoint host and the data-residency geography. Must be a mantle-supported region. Only relevant when `INTAKE_LLM_PROVIDER=bedrock`. |
| `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` | no | — | Fallback read by the standard AWS credential chain if `AWS_REGION` is unset; set both for clarity. |
| `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK` | no | unset (SigV4 fallback) | **Dev only** — a short-term Bedrock API key. If present it overrides SigV4 and bypasses the runtime IAM role, so it must stay unset in production. Never use a long-term Bedrock API key. See `docs/deployment/bedrock-enterprise.md` §2. |
| `AWS_PROFILE` | no | — | Standard AWS SDK credential-chain variable — selects a named local profile for local/dev use. Not read directly by this project's code; honored by the AWS credential chain `AnthropicBedrockMantle` resolves against (constructor args → env vars → shared config → SSO / assumed roles / ECS task role / EKS IRSA / IMDS). In production prefer an IAM role over a named profile. |
| `MPC_CI_BASE_IMAGE` | no | `python:3.11` (script-level, `CIHostConfig.base_image`) | Base image for the **generated project's** `.gitlab-ci.yml` — not this repository's own CI. Read directly by `scripts/run_pipeline.py`'s `build_ci_host_config()`; also settable via the website agent CLI's `--ci-base-image`. Phase C3b (`docs/planning/enterprise-migration.md`). |
| `MPC_CI_INDEX_URL` | no | unset (public PyPI) | Python package index URL threaded into the **generated project's** CI (`UV_INDEX_URL` + the `pip install uv` step) on both GitLab and GitHub. Same script-level/CLI-flag pattern as `MPC_CI_BASE_IMAGE`. |
| `MPC_CI_ACTION_PREFIX` | no | `actions` (`CIHostConfig.action_prefix`) | Marketplace/org prefix for the **generated project's** GitHub Actions steps (e.g. `{prefix}/checkout@v4`). Same script-level/CLI-flag pattern as `MPC_CI_BASE_IMAGE`. |
| `MPC_CI_PRE_COMMIT_REPO` | no | `https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit` (`CIHostConfig.pre_commit_repo`) | Repo URL for the ruff pre-commit hook baked into every **generated project** (both CI platforms). Same script-level/CLI-flag pattern as `MPC_CI_BASE_IMAGE`. |

Use `OrchestratorSettings.require_host_token()` /
`require_anthropic_api_key()` inside runners that actually make HTTP
calls — the settings object is constructable without these so that
tests and preview runs can skip them.

## 2. Checkpoint layout

`CheckpointStore(base_dir)` writes every inter-agent handoff as a
JSON envelope plus a terminal plain-JSON result. For a run with
`run_id="run_abc"` and `MPC_CHECKPOINT_DIR=/var/lib/mpc/checkpoints`:

```
/var/lib/mpc/checkpoints/run_abc/
    IntakeReport.json          # HandoffEnvelope(payload_type=IntakeReport)
    DataRequest.json           # HandoffEnvelope(payload_type=DataRequest)
    DataReport.json            # HandoffEnvelope(payload_type=DataReport)
    RepoTarget.json            # HandoffEnvelope(payload_type=RepoTarget)
    RepoProjectResult.result.json   # terminal result (not an envelope)
```

The `.result.json` suffix is load-bearing: it guarantees the terminal
artifact cannot collide with an envelope even if a registered payload
type happens to be named `RepoProjectResult`. Envelopes conform to
`schemas/envelope.py`; the terminal result is a plain
`RepoProjectResult` Pydantic dump.

Which files are present tells you exactly how far a run got:

| Files present | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| `IntakeReport.json` only | Halted at intake; see `failure_reason` in the run's `PipelineResult` or the intake report's `status` field. |
| `IntakeReport.json`, `DataRequest.json`, `DataReport.json` | Halted at data; the Data Agent produced a non-`COMPLETE` report. |
| Plus `RepoTarget.json` and `RepoProjectResult.result.json` | Website phase reached. Check the result's `status` to distinguish `COMPLETE` from `FAILED`. |

The full `PipelineResult` is NOT persisted to disk — the orchestrator
returns it in-process. If you need the terminal status after a crash,
reconstruct it from the checkpoint files.

---

## 3. Observability integration

The orchestrator ships with two optional modules that wrap agent
runners; `pipeline.py` itself has no observability imports, so
instrumentation is opt-in per deployment.

### 3.1 Structured logging (`orchestrator/logging.py`)

`make_logged_runner(runner, *, agent_name, run_id, correlation_id)`
returns a wrapped callable that emits three event types via stdlib
`logging` to the `model_project_constructor.orchestrator` namespace:

| Event | Level | Context fields |
|---|---|---|
| `agent.start` | INFO | `agent`, `run_id`, `correlation_id` |
| `agent.end` | INFO | plus `duration_ms`, `status` |
| `agent.error` | ERROR | plus `duration_ms`, `error_type` |

`error_type` is the exception's class name (a class whose name is not a
short ASCII identifier, or cannot be read, is shown as `<unprintable>`).
**What the exception said is deliberately not logged**, and there is no
`error_message` field (it existed until Session 276; a log processor that
read it now finds it absent). An exception's text is whatever the code
that raised it put in it — a pydantic validation error quotes the input it
refused, a database driver can echo the connection back, a gateway's error
page can echo a header — and the JSON formatter below writes the whole
context, so a message in the context can put a token in the log file.
Nothing that needs no secret can find a bare token in free text, so the
wrapper does not read the text at all, attaches no traceback (which would
print it), and emits the event after it has left its `except` block (a log
handler that fails while writing would otherwise have the exception
chained to its own failure, and `logging` prints that chain).

The wrapper re-raises the exception unchanged, so for an intake or data
crash that escapes its agent the code that called the pipeline can print or
scrub it with what that code knows. (A crash inside the Data Agent's graph does
not escape: `DataAgent.run` saves it as a report that names the class,
`TROUBLESHOOTING.md` §FAILED_AT_DATA.) **A website-stage crash is different:** `run_pipeline`
catches it and saves a FAILED result that names the class and nothing it
said (`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `unexpected_error:`), so that text is recorded
nowhere. To see it, run the website stage by itself (§4.1–§4.3), which
does not go through `run_pipeline` and lets an unexpected exception reach
the command line as a traceback, against a scratch namespace.

All structured fields land on the log record's `extra={"context": ...}`
dict. To produce JSON logs, install a JSON formatter on the
`model_project_constructor.orchestrator` logger — for example
`python-json-logger`:

```python
import logging
from pythonjsonlogger import jsonlogger

handler = logging.StreamHandler()
handler.setFormatter(jsonlogger.JsonFormatter(
    "%(asctime)s %(name)s %(levelname)s %(message)s"
))
logging.getLogger("model_project_constructor.orchestrator").addHandler(handler)
```

### 3.2 Metrics (`orchestrator/metrics.py`)

`MetricsRegistry` is a thread-safe in-memory counter store with three
surfaces:

- `record_run(status)` — increment run count and status distribution.
- `record_agent_latency(agent, duration_ms)` — accumulate latency
  samples per agent.
- `snapshot() -> MetricsSnapshot` — immutable view for dashboards /
  assertions.

Wrap each runner with `make_measured_runner(runner, agent_name=...,
registry=...)`. Typical deployment:

```python
from model_project_constructor.orchestrator import (
    MetricsRegistry,
    make_logged_runner,
    make_measured_runner,
    run_pipeline,
)

metrics = MetricsRegistry()

def instrument(runner, name, config):
    return make_logged_runner(
        make_measured_runner(runner, agent_name=name, registry=metrics),
        agent_name=name,
        run_id=config.run_id,
        correlation_id=config.correlation_id,
    )

intake_runner  = instrument(real_intake_runner,  "intake",  config)
data_runner    = instrument(real_data_runner,    "data",    config)
website_runner = instrument(real_website_runner, "website", config)

result = run_pipeline(
    config,
    intake_runner=intake_runner,
    data_runner=data_runner,
    website_runner=website_runner,
)
metrics.record_run(result.status)
```

A Prometheus exporter is a post-pilot concern; for now, snapshot the
registry periodically and emit it to whatever observability surface
your deployment already has.

---

## 4. Running the pipeline

### 4.1 Against fake hosts (no credentials)

```bash
uv run python -m model_project_constructor.agents.website \
    --intake tests/fixtures/subrogation_intake.json \
    --data tests/fixtures/sample_datareport.json \
    --fake
```

This validates the scaffolding end-to-end without touching any live
host. It is the recommended smoke test before a live run and is run
by CI on every commit.

The emitted CI manifest follows `--host` by default (`--host gitlab`
emits `.gitlab-ci.yml`; `--host github` emits
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Pass `--ci-platform {gitlab,github}` to
override the CI manifest independently of the repo host — useful for
fake-path testing when you want to validate the opposite platform's
manifest shape without a live run. Applies to every recipe in §4.1 /
§4.2 / §4.3; ignored by `scripts/run_pipeline.py` (§4.4), which always
emits the manifest for its `--host`.

### 4.2 Against a live GitLab instance

Prerequisite: `GITLAB_TOKEN` set in the environment (see §1).

```bash
uv run python -m model_project_constructor.agents.website \
    --intake tests/fixtures/subrogation_intake.json \
    --data tests/fixtures/sample_datareport.json \
    --host gitlab \
    --host-url https://gitlab.example.com \
    --namespace data-science/model-drafts \
    --private-token "$GITLAB_TOKEN"
```

Substitute your instance URL for `https://gitlab.example.com` and your
own pre-built `IntakeReport` / `DataReport` JSON (matching
`schemas.v1.intake` / `schemas.v1.data`) for non-fixture runs. This CLI
is flag-driven — the `MPC_*` env vars in §1 are read by
`scripts/run_pipeline.py` (§4.4), not by this entry point. The Website
Agent itself makes no Claude calls, so `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is not
required here.

### 4.3 Against a live GitHub / GitHub Enterprise

Prerequisite: `GITHUB_TOKEN` set in the environment (see §1).

```bash
uv run python -m model_project_constructor.agents.website \
    --intake tests/fixtures/subrogation_intake.json \
    --data tests/fixtures/sample_datareport.json \
    --host github \
    --namespace acme \
    --private-token "$GITHUB_TOKEN"
```

For GitHub Enterprise, add
`--host-url https://github.mycompany.com/api/v3` (or your Enterprise
instance's API URL). GitHub does not support nested namespaces; pass a
single owner / org as `--namespace`. Substitute your own pre-built
`IntakeReport` / `DataReport` JSON for non-fixture runs.

### 4.4 Scope B: real LLM-backed pipeline via `scripts/run_pipeline.py`

`scripts/run_pipeline.py` is the canonical end-to-end driver. It is
what CI exercises (with fakes) and what operator runs for smoke testing
and pilot runs. It accepts a `--llm` flag that selects which stages use
the real Anthropic API:

| `--llm` | Intake | Data | Cost per run | Determinism |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `none` (default) | fixture | fixture | free | fully deterministic |
| `data` (B1) | fixture | real Anthropic | ~$0.10–$0.50 (model-dependent) | non-deterministic data stage |
| `both` (B2) | real Anthropic (scripted answers) | real Anthropic | ~$0.15–$0.75 | non-deterministic intake + data |

#### 4.4.1 B1 — real data agent (intake stays fixture)

Typical live B1 invocation against public GitLab:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
export GITLAB_TOKEN=...
export MPC_HOST=gitlab
export MPC_HOST_URL=https://gitlab.com
export MPC_NAMESPACE=your-group/subgroup          # path only, NOT a URL

uv run python scripts/run_pipeline.py \
    --live --host gitlab --llm data \
    --model claude-opus-4-7 \
    --run-id run_b1_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
```

#### 4.4.2 B2 — real intake (scripted answers) + real data

B2 drives `IntakeAgent.run_scripted` with real Anthropic-generated
questions and fixture-supplied answers. The fixture's `draft_after`
field is a no-op in this mode — only the real LLM decides when it has
enough information — so the fixture needs enough `qa_pairs` to cover the
LLM's questions. Use a fixture with **at least `MAX_QUESTIONS` qa_pairs**
(currently `MAX_QUESTIONS=20` at `intake/state.py:57`) to guarantee the
graph terminates: if the LLM hasn't flipped `believe_enough_info` by
turn `MAX_QUESTIONS`, the graph drafts anyway with
`missing_fields=["questions_cap_reached"]` → `DRAFT_INCOMPLETE`. See
`tests/fixtures/subrogation_b2.yaml` for a working example (15 qa_pairs,
pre-answering latency SLA / recovery-per-claim / fairness-plan).

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a

uv run python scripts/run_pipeline.py \
    --live --host gitlab --llm both \
    --model claude-opus-4-7 \
    --intake-fixture tests/fixtures/subrogation_b2.yaml \
    --run-id run_b2_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
```

If the fixture runs out of answers before the LLM is satisfied (and
before turn 10), or if Anthropic raises (rate limit, bad JSON), the
inline `_draft_incomplete_from_exception` adapter converts the error
into a `DRAFT_INCOMPLETE` `IntakeReport` and the orchestrator halts
cleanly with `FAILED_AT_INTAKE`. The run exits non-zero but leaves a
checkpoint envelope documenting the failure. The report names the
exception's class (`interview_aborted: <ExceptionClass>`) and never its
message. A model client or a gateway can quote the request headers, and so
the API key, in a message; the `Failure:` line is printed and the report is
saved to disk, so the message stays out of both. A report saved by a run
from before this change can still hold it (`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
§FAILED_AT_INTAKE says how to find one).

The data stage follows the same rule. An exception that escapes the Data
Agent's graph is saved in `DataReport.json` as `graph crashed:
<ExceptionClass>`, one raised while the report is built from the model's replies
(a value outside the row-count vocabulary, too few quality-check groups) as
`report assembly failed: <ExceptionClass>`, and a baseline query the model client
could not generate as `LLM baseline-query generation failed: <ExceptionClass>` in
the baseline's `caveats`; none carries the message (`TROUBLESHOOTING.md` §FAILED_AT_DATA
says what the classes mean and how to read the message). A `DataReport.json`
from before Session 279 can still hold the message and a key, and so can the
project the website stage generated from a `COMPLETE` one (§FAILED_AT_INTAKE
says where to look).

Flags:

- `--llm {none,data,both}` — `none` runs the fixture pipeline, `data`
  runs B1 (real data only), `both` runs B2 (real intake + real data).
- `--intake-fixture PATH` — required when `--llm=both`. YAML fixture
  supplying scripted answers and stakeholder/session identity. Ignored
  otherwise.
- `--model ID` — overrides the Anthropic model for BOTH the intake
  and data agents. Default is `claude-opus-4-7`. Other options include
  `claude-sonnet-4-6` (~5× cheaper) and `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`
  (fastest, lowest quality).
- `--db-url URL` — optional; passes a SQLAlchemy URL so quality checks
  execute against a real read-only store. Omit for pilot runs.
- `--run-id ID` — embed a timestamp suffix when invoking repeatedly
  so checkpoint envelopes stay disambiguated across runs.

#### 4.4.3 Verify the LLM actually ran

Inspect the data envelope (B1 or B2):

```bash
python -c "
from pathlib import Path
import json
env = json.loads(
    Path('.orchestrator/checkpoints/<run_id>/DataReport.json').read_text()
)
report = env['payload']
print('status:', report['status'])
print('queries:', len(report['primary_queries']))
print('sql_preview:', report['primary_queries'][0]['sql'][:120])
"
```

If `sql_preview` differs from `tests/fixtures/sample_datareport.json`,
the real LLM ran. For B2, also inspect the intake envelope: the
`business_problem` + `proposed_solution` prose will differ from
`tests/fixtures/subrogation_intake.json` when Claude drafted, and
`questions_asked` will be between 1 and 10 for a real interview
(a DRAFT_INCOMPLETE stub reports `questions_asked: 0`).

---

## 5. Resume after a partial run

A crashed run is resumed with `--resume <run_id>`. (A crash or Ctrl-C **inside the
website stage** is the exception: since Session 275 it is saved as a `FAILED`
result, so `--resume` refuses; the project may already exist on the host. See
`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `FAILED_AT_WEBSITE`.) The orchestrator
inspects `$MPC_CHECKPOINT_DIR/<run_id>/`, reuses every envelope already
on disk, and re-executes from the first missing stage onward.

### 5.1 Recommended path: `--resume`

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_pipeline.py \
    --live --host gitlab --llm data \
    --resume run_b1_20260418_142307
```

Behavior by checkpoint state:

| On disk | Resumes at | Operator outcome |
|---|---|---|
| (no dir) | — | Exit 2 with `no checkpoints at <path>` |
| `IntakeReport.json` only | `intake_to_data_adapter` | Re-derives request, runs data + website |
| `+ DataRequest.json` | `data` | Runs data + website |
| `+ DataReport.json` | `website` | Runs website only |
| `+ RepoProjectResult.result.json` (status=`COMPLETE`) | (no-op) | Exit 0 with project URL |
| `+ RepoProjectResult.result.json` (status=`FAILED`) | (refused) | Exit 2 with retry recipe (also after the website stage raised or was interrupted: `unexpected_error:` / `interrupted:`) |
| Successor without predecessor | (refused) | Exit 2 (`ResumeInconsistent`) |

The resume banner names the chosen point and the skipped stages, e.g.:

```
  Run ID: run_b1_20260418_142307  (RESUMED from: data)
  Skipping: intake, intake_to_data_adapter
```

`--resume` overrides `--run-id` — there is no need to pass both. The
operator-supplied `MPC_NAMESPACE` / `MPC_HOST_URL` (i.e.
`config.repo_target`) **always** wins over any saved `RepoTarget.json`
on the resumed run; if the operator deliberately re-points to a
different host between runs, that is the active intent (plan §6.4).

The truth table that drives the `(point, skipped, re-executed)` mapping
lives in `docs/architecture-history/resume-from-checkpoint-plan.md` §5.

### 5.2 Manual fallback (unusual cases)

For one-off recovery work that does not fit the `--resume` envelope —
e.g. you want to load an envelope into a Python REPL, mutate it, and
hand-run the next stage — read the envelope directly:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from model_project_constructor.orchestrator import CheckpointStore

store = CheckpointStore(Path("/var/lib/mpc/checkpoints"))
intake = store.load_payload("run_abc", "IntakeReport")
data   = store.load_payload("run_abc", "DataReport")   # if present
```

Then construct a `PipelineConfig` and call `run_pipeline` programmatically
with stub runners that return the loaded payloads. This is the recipe
that `--resume` automates; reach for it only when the CLI does not
fit the situation.

---

## 6. Common pre-flight checks

Before every live run:

```bash
# Type check + lint + full test suite + decoupling test.
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
uv run mypy src/
uv run pytest -q
```

A green pre-flight run is a precondition for any live invocation; do
not skip these because "it worked yesterday." Phase 6 added a
repo-level CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that runs exactly
this matrix on every push.
