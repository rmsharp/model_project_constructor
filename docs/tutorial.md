# Tutorial: Running the Model Project Constructor Pipeline

This tutorial walks you through your first end-to-end pipeline run, from generating an intake report to inspecting the scaffolded project. No API keys or credentials are needed -- everything runs locally with fixture data and an in-memory fake repository.

A second tutorial (forthcoming) covers live LLM-backed interviews and real GitLab/GitHub deployments.

---

## What this tool does

The Model Project Constructor is a multi-agent pipeline that takes a business model idea and turns it into a governance-scaffolded repository project. The pipeline has three stages:

1. **Intake Agent** -- Conducts a guided interview with a business stakeholder to capture the business problem, proposed solution, model solution, and estimated value. Produces an `IntakeReport`.

2. **Data Agent** -- Takes the intake report and generates SQL queries to collect relevant data, writes quality-check queries, and confirms expectations about the data. Produces a `DataReport`.

3. **Website Agent** -- Takes both reports and scaffolds a repository project (GitLab or GitHub) containing a draft model website with business understanding, implementation plans, data documentation, and initial model build sections. Produces a `RepoProjectResult`.

The orchestrator (`run_pipeline`) drives the three agents in sequence, persisting inter-agent handoffs as checkpoint envelopes so a failed run can be inspected and recovered.

---

## Prerequisites

### Install the project

Clone the repository (substitute your clone URL):

```bash
git clone <repo-url> model_project_constructor
```

Enter the project directory:

```bash
cd model_project_constructor
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --extra agents --extra ui --extra dev
```

The `agents` extra installs LangGraph, Anthropic SDK, GitLab/GitHub client libraries, and Typer (CLI). The `ui` extra installs FastAPI and related dependencies for the intake web UI. The `dev` extra adds pytest, mypy, and ruff.

### Verify the install

```bash
uv run pytest -q
```

You should see the full test suite pass with high coverage.

## Step 1: Create the intake fixture

The intake agent's input is a YAML file containing a scripted interview -- questions and answers that describe the business problem a model should solve. In production, these answers come from a live conversation with a business stakeholder (via the web UI or CLI). For this tutorial, we provide them as a fixture.

Create a file called `my_intake.yaml` in the project root with the following content:

```yaml
schema: intake_fixture/v1
stakeholder_id: stakeholder_claims_001
session_id: intake_subrogation_001
domain: pc_claims
initial_problem: >-
  Subrogation recovery rates have dropped since rolling out a new claims system;
  we want a model that helps adjusters flag recoverable claims and prompts them
  to capture required evidence during intake.

qa_pairs:
  - question: "Can you describe the business problem in your own words?"
    answer: >-
      Since we deployed the new claims system ~14 months ago our subrogation
      recovery rate dropped roughly 20%. That's millions of dollars a year
      we're not recovering from at-fault parties.
  - question: "What do you believe is causing the drop in recovery?"
    answer: >-
      Adjusters aren't capturing the information we need to pursue subrogation:
      police reports, the other party's insurer, clear fault evidence. The new
      UI makes those fields easy to skip and there's no KPI tying adjuster
      performance to subrogation outcomes.
  - question: "What solution have you been considering?"
    answer: >-
      A prompt-based system embedded in the claims workflow that reminds
      adjusters to collect the required evidence, and a scoring model that
      flags claims likely to succeed in subrogation so we can prioritize them.
  - question: "If a model were to help, what would it predict and on what features?"
    answer: >-
      A binary classification: 1 = subrogation succeeded, 0 = did not. Features
      would include completeness of captured info, adjuster experience, claim
      type, time from incident to filing, damage amount, and evidence of fault.
  - question: "What data do we have available for training?"
    answer: >-
      Our claims datawarehouse has records back to 2020 including outcomes.
      We also have adjuster metadata and the structured intake fields from the
      old and new systems.
  - question: "How would you estimate the annual value of success?"
    answer: >-
      Subrogation recovery is roughly $30M/yr. A 10% lift is ~$3M annually
      and I'd guess we could get somewhere between $2M and $4M.
  - question: "Do any adjuster or claimant attributes we'd use count as protected?"
    answer: >-
      No — we deliberately exclude protected attributes. The model uses claim
      features and adjuster tenure only.

draft_after: 7

draft:
  business_problem: >-
    Subrogation recovery dropped ~20% since deployment of a new claims
    system, primarily because adjusters no longer capture evidence required
    to pursue recovery (police reports, third-party insurer, fault evidence).
    There is no adjuster KPI tying performance to subrogation outcomes and
    the new UI deprioritizes the relevant intake fields.
  proposed_solution: >-
    Embed structured prompts in the claims workflow so adjusters capture the
    required evidence during intake, and surface a per-claim subrogation
    probability score so claims likely to recover are prioritized. Success is
    measured on subrogation recovery rate over a 12-month rolling window.

```

The fixture has three sections:

- **`qa_pairs`** -- The interview itself: seven question-answer pairs capturing the business problem, proposed solution, available data, estimated value, and governance considerations. This is what a business stakeholder provides.
- **`draft`** -- The structured report the intake agent assembles from the answers. In a live run the LLM writes this; in a fixture run it is provided directly. The draft has **five required sections**: `business_problem`, `proposed_solution`, `model_solution`, `estimated_value` (extended with cost-of-inaction + implementation-cost band + payback + value drivers), and `value_measurement_plan` (baseline metric, counterfactual design, evaluation horizon, success criteria, decision rights — see [Intake Interview Design §4.5](https://github.com/rmsharp/model_project_constructor/wiki/Intake-Interview-Design)). For `status="COMPLETE"`, the plan's `baseline_metric_name` and `evaluation_horizon_months` must both be non-null.
- **`governance`** and **`review_sequence`** -- Risk classification and whether the stakeholder accepts the draft on first review.

---

## Step 2: Generate the IntakeReport JSON

Run the intake agent against the fixture to produce the structured JSON report:

```bash
uv run model-intake-agent --fixture my_intake.yaml --output my_intake_report.json
```

This drives the intake agent through the scripted interview and writes the `IntakeReport` to `my_intake_report.json`. You can inspect it:

```bash
cat my_intake_report.json | python -m json.tool | head -20
```

You should see a JSON object with `"status": "COMPLETE"` and structured fields for the business problem, model solution, estimated value, and governance metadata.

---

## Step 3: Run the pipeline

Now run the full pipeline using the intake report you just generated. The script uses a pre-built `DataReport` fixture (since the data agent needs a database connection for a real run) and an in-memory fake repository client.

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_pipeline.py
```

This will:

1. Load the pre-built `IntakeReport` from `tests/fixtures/subrogation_intake.json` (matching what you generated in Step 2)
2. Load a pre-built `DataReport` (1.28M-row training set with quality checks) from `tests/fixtures/sample_datareport.json`
3. Wire up a `WebsiteAgent` backed by an in-memory `FakeRepoClient`
4. Run the full Intake -> Data -> Website pipeline through the orchestrator
5. Print the result, metrics, checkpoint files, and generated project files

### Command-line options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--run-id ID` | Auto-generated | Unique identifier for this run |
| `--host gitlab\|github` | `gitlab` | Target host platform |
| `--checkpoint-dir PATH` | `.orchestrator/checkpoints` | Where checkpoint envelopes are written |
| `--live` | off | Use a real repo host (see Step 5) |

### Try GitHub CI output

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_pipeline.py --host github
```

The generated project will contain `.github/workflows/ci.yml` instead of `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

**Decoupling CI from host.** `scripts/run_pipeline.py` always ties the CI manifest to `--host`. To emit a CI manifest that differs from the repo host (e.g. a GitHub Actions workflow into a GitLab project for fake-mode cross-platform testing), use the standalone website CLI with `--ci-platform {gitlab,github}`; see `OPERATIONS.md` §4.1 for the recipe.

---

## Step 4: Inspect the checkpoints

Every inter-agent handoff is persisted as a JSON envelope in the checkpoint directory. After a run, you can inspect what each agent produced:

```bash
ls .orchestrator/checkpoints/run_*/
```

View the intake report that was passed to the data stage:

```bash
cat .orchestrator/checkpoints/run_*/IntakeReport.json | python -m json.tool | head -30
```

View the final project result:

```bash
cat .orchestrator/checkpoints/run_*/RepoProjectResult.result.json | python -m json.tool
```

The checkpoint layout tells you exactly how far a run got:

| Files present | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `IntakeReport.json` only | Failed at intake |
| `+ DataRequest.json + DataReport.json` | Failed at data |
| `+ RepoTarget.json + RepoProjectResult.result.json` | Reached website (check `status` for COMPLETE vs FAILED) |

---

## Step 5: Live run against a real repo host

When you are ready to create an actual repository project, set up credentials and use the `--live` flag.

### 5a: Set up environment variables

Copy the template and fill in your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```bash
# For GitLab:
MPC_HOST=gitlab
GITLAB_TOKEN=glpat-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Or for GitHub:
# MPC_HOST=github
# GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# For real LLM-backed agents (not needed for fixture-based runs):
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Load the environment (choose one method):

**Option A — direnv** (if you use it):

```bash
echo "dotenv" > .envrc && direnv allow
```

**Option B — manual export:**

```bash
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)
```

**Option C — source a wrapper:**

```bash
source <(grep -v '^#' .env | sed 's/^/export /')
```

### 5b: Run with --live

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_pipeline.py --live --host gitlab
```

This will create a real GitLab project at `https://gitlab.com/<namespace>/subrogation_pilot` (or a suffixed name if the project already exists) containing the full model website scaffold.

For GitHub:

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_pipeline.py --live --host github
```

### 5c: Customize the target

Set the `MPC_NAMESPACE` environment variable to control where the project is created. **`MPC_NAMESPACE` must be a path, not a URL** — the GitLab and GitHub adapters look up the group/org by path, so pasting the full URL surfaces as an unhelpful `404`. The orchestrator rejects URL-prefixed values at config-load time. Pick the form that matches your host:

GitLab top-level group path:

```bash
export MPC_NAMESPACE="rmsharp-modelpilot"
```

GitLab nested group path:

```bash
export MPC_NAMESPACE="data-science/model-drafts"
```

GitHub org or personal account:

```bash
export MPC_NAMESPACE="my-github-org"
```

If you accidentally paste the URL form, the script fails fast before any agent runs:

```
$ MPC_NAMESPACE=https://gitlab.com/rmsharp-modelpilot uv run python scripts/run_pipeline.py --live --host gitlab
ConfigError: MPC_NAMESPACE must be a group path, not a URL; got 'https://gitlab.com/rmsharp-modelpilot'.
Use the path only, e.g. 'rmsharp-modelpilot' instead of 'https://gitlab.com/rmsharp-modelpilot'.
```

For self-hosted GitLab or GitHub Enterprise, set the host URL for your platform:

Self-hosted GitLab:

```bash
export MPC_HOST_URL="https://gitlab.internal.company.com"
```

GitHub Enterprise:

```bash
export MPC_HOST_URL="https://github.mycompany.com/api/v3"
```

---

## Step 6: Real LLM-backed run (Scope B-1)

Steps 1–5 run the full pipeline but use fixture data for the intake and data stages — no Claude calls are made. Step 6 graduates the **data stage** to a real Anthropic-backed data agent while keeping the intake on the fixture. This proves that Claude can actually write SQL for your subrogation request and feed a `DataReport` the website stage can consume.

> **Prerequisite:** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` must be set (see §5a). The fixture intake `tests/fixtures/subrogation_intake.json` is still used, so no intake interview is required.

### 6a: Run with `--llm data`

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_pipeline.py \
    --live --host gitlab --llm data \
    --model claude-opus-4-7 \
    --run-id run_b1_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
```

What changes vs. `--live` alone:

- The data runner is now `DataAgent(make_llm_client(provider, model=...)).run`, not a lambda serving the fixture `sample_datareport.json`.
- Claude generates primary queries, quality checks, a summary, and one datasheet per primary query.
- Cost: ~$0.10–$0.50 per run depending on model (see §6c).
- Runtime: adds 30–90 s vs. the fake run.

The intake stage is unchanged from Step 5 — fixture-driven. To graduate the intake to a real LLM as well, see §6e (`--llm both`).

### 6b: Verify the data side actually ran against the API

Read the `DataReport.json` envelope and confirm the SQL differs from the fixture:

```bash
python -c "
from pathlib import Path
import json
env = json.loads(
    Path('.orchestrator/checkpoints/<run_id>/DataReport.json').read_text()
)
report = env['payload']
print('status:', report['status'])
print('queries:', len(report['primary_queries']))
print('sql_preview:', report['primary_queries'][0]['sql'][:120])
"
```

The fixture's first query opens with `SELECT claim_id, ...`; a live Claude run produces model-generated SQL that varies by prompt and model. If your preview looks identical to the fixture, something is wrong — rerun with a fresh `--run-id` to rule out checkpoint staleness.

### 6c: Model selection

Override the default with `--model`:

| Model ID | Strength | Cost (relative) |
|---|---|---|
| `claude-opus-4-7` (default) | highest quality; best for first-impression pilot runs | 5× |
| `claude-sonnet-4-6` | fast, cost-effective; fine for iterating | 1× |
| `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | cheapest, fastest; may miss subtle semantics | 0.2× |

For production, tune by running each model on a representative request and inspecting the generated SQL. For the first pilot run, `claude-opus-4-7` removes "was it the model?" as a confounding variable when judging output quality.

**Provider selection (`--provider`).** `--provider` (default `anthropic`) selects the LLM backend and, like `--model`, applies to **both** stages. Construction routes through each agent's `make_llm_client` factory. Three providers ship today — `anthropic`, `bedrock` (Claude via AWS Bedrock), and `opencode` (the `opencode` CLI driven as a subprocess, so the underlying vendor is whatever that tool is configured for) — proof that the factory's forward-looking seam (audit §E4) works: each is one new client module plus one factory branch, with no change at the call sites. Neither non-default provider is validated: `bedrock` has never been exercised against a live endpoint, and `opencode` runs but its output quality is unmeasured, so `anthropic` remains the default. `opencode` additionally needs its binary on `PATH` and an explicit `--model` (it pins no default). An unknown provider fails fast (`ValueError`) before any API call. The flag is also exposed on the standalone data-agent CLI (`model-data-agent run`/`discover --provider`).

### 6d: Optional: connect a read-only database

By default `--db-url` is omitted and the data agent **generates** quality checks but does not **execute** them. To execute:

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_pipeline.py \
    --live --host gitlab --llm data \
    --db-url sqlite:///path/to/readonly.db \
    --run-id run_b1_db_$(date +%s)
```

The URL follows SQLAlchemy syntax (`postgresql://user:pass@host/db`, `sqlite:///path`, etc.). When connected, the `DataReport.confirmed_expectations` field will be populated based on real query results instead of the standard "database unreachable" line. Scope B-1 deliberately defaults to disconnected — the pilot's goal is to prove Claude's query generation, not debug SQL connectivity at the same time.

### 6e: Scripted-answers intake (`--llm both`, Scope B-2)

`--llm both` drives a real Claude-backed intake interview with answers pulled from a YAML fixture. Claude generates the questions and decides when it has enough information to draft; the fixture supplies the stakeholder's answers verbatim.

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_pipeline.py \
    --live --host gitlab --llm both \
    --model claude-opus-4-7 \
    --intake-fixture tests/fixtures/subrogation_b2.yaml \
    --run-id run_b2_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
```

How it differs from `--llm data`:

- The intake runner is `IntakeAgent(make_llm_client(provider, model=...)).run_scripted(...)`. Claude asks its own questions, decides when to flip `believe_enough_info`, drafts the four required sections, and classifies governance.
- The fixture's `draft_after` field is a **no-op** in this mode — only the LLM decides when to stop interviewing. The fixture just supplies answers. Provide at least as many `qa_pairs` as `MAX_QUESTIONS` (see `src/model_project_constructor/agents/intake/state.py:57`) to guarantee the graph terminates.
- `--model` applies to **both** stages. Mixed-model runs (e.g. haiku for intake, opus for data) are not supported.
- Cost: ~$0.15–$0.75 per run (intake ~5–12 Claude calls + data as before).
- Runtime: 60–90 s for intake + 2–5 min for data.

**Failure behavior.** If the fixture runs out of answers before Claude is satisfied, or if Claude raises (rate limit, bad JSON, network), the inline `_draft_incomplete_from_exception` adapter converts the error into a `DRAFT_INCOMPLETE` `IntakeReport` so the pipeline halts with `PipelineResult.status == "FAILED_AT_INTAKE"` rather than crashing. Inspect `.orchestrator/checkpoints/<run_id>/IntakeReport.json` (the report is under `payload`) to see which exception stopped the interview: `missing_fields[0]` reads `interview_aborted: <ExceptionClass>`. Only the class name is recorded, never what the exception said. A model client or a gateway can quote the request headers, and so the API key, in its message, and this string is printed as `Failure:` and saved to disk. A bare `RuntimeError` is the scripted driver stopping itself (the fixture ran out of interview answers or of review responses, the graph hit an interrupt of a kind it does not know, or it exceeded its turn cap); `IntakeLLMError` is a model reply the client could not use (cut off at the token limit, not JSON, empty, or missing a key); an `anthropic` error class names the HTTP status or the connection (`BadRequestError` for any 400, `RateLimitError`, `APIConnectionError`). A report saved by a run from before this change can still hold the full message: see `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.

**Verify the intake side ran.** The intake envelope's `business_problem` + `proposed_solution` prose will differ from `tests/fixtures/subrogation_intake.json`, and `questions_asked` will be between 1 and `MAX_QUESTIONS` for a real interview (the DRAFT_INCOMPLETE stub emitted by the adapter reports `questions_asked: 0`).

---

## Step 7: Resuming a partial run

Pipelines fail. A rate-limited Claude call, a transient GitLab 5xx, a
network hiccup mid-website-push — any of these can halt a run partway
through. Because every inter-agent handoff is persisted as a checkpoint
envelope (see Step 4), you can pick up where the run halted instead of
starting over:

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_pipeline.py \
    --live --host gitlab --llm data \
    --resume run_b1_20260418_142307
```

The orchestrator inspects `<checkpoint_dir>/<run_id>/`, loads every
envelope already on disk, and re-executes from the first missing stage.
The banner names the resume point and the stages it is skipping:

```
  Run ID: run_b1_20260418_142307  (RESUMED from: data)
  Skipping: intake, intake_to_data_adapter
```

`--resume` overrides `--run-id` — pass only the resumed run's id. If
the checkpoint directory is missing, the run is already complete, or
the envelopes on disk are inconsistent (a successor without its
predecessor), the script exits with a friendly message and a non-zero
exit code instead of silently starting fresh.

For the full case-by-case behavior (what counts as "already complete",
how to retry a `FAILED` website stage, how to recover from manual
checkpoint-dir mutation) see `OPERATIONS.md` §5. The truth table that
drives the resume-point decision lives in
`docs/architecture-history/resume-from-checkpoint-plan.md` §5.

## Step 8: Using the orchestrator programmatically

For integration into larger systems, use the `run_pipeline` function directly:

```python
from pathlib import Path

from model_project_constructor.agents.website.agent import WebsiteAgent
from model_project_constructor.agents.website.fake_client import FakeRepoClient
from model_project_constructor.orchestrator import (
    MetricsRegistry,
    PipelineConfig,
    make_logged_runner,
    make_measured_runner,
    run_pipeline,
)
from model_project_constructor.schemas.v1.data import DataReport
from model_project_constructor.schemas.v1.intake import IntakeReport
from model_project_constructor.schemas.v1.repo import RepoTarget

# Load your reports (from files, LLM agents, or any other source)
intake = IntakeReport.model_validate_json(Path("intake.json").read_text())
data = DataReport.model_validate_json(Path("data.json").read_text())

# Configure the run
config = PipelineConfig(

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `ConfigError: GITLAB_TOKEN is required` | Missing credentials in `--live` mode | Set `GITLAB_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` in your environment |
| `ConfigError: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is required` | Agent runner needs LLM access | Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for real LLM-backed runs |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: langgraph` | Missing `agents` extra | Run `uv sync --extra agents` |
| Pipeline halts at `FAILED_AT_INTAKE` | Intake report has `DRAFT_INCOMPLETE` status | Check the intake fixture or re-run the intake interview |
| Pipeline halts at `FAILED_AT_DATA` | Data report has non-COMPLETE status | Check data agent logs or the `DataReport.status` field |
| Project name conflict on live host | Project already exists in namespace | The website agent auto-suffixes; check the `project_url` in the result |

For detailed failure-mode diagnostics, see `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.

## What the generated project contains

A successful run creates a repository project with:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `README.md` | Project overview with business context |
| `.gitlab-ci.yml` or `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | CI pipeline for the model project |
| `analysis/` | Quarto notebooks: business understanding, data, EDA, feature engineering, initial models, implementation plan, extensions |
| `data/` | Data documentation and datasheets |
| `queries/` | SQL queries (primary + quality checks) |
| `reports/` | Intake and data reports in JSON and Markdown |
| `src/` | Initial model build scaffolding (data loading, features, models, evaluation) |
| `tests/` | Test stubs for each source module |
| `governance/` | Governance artifacts (proportional to risk tier): model card, deployment gates, monitoring plan, regulatory compliance |

The project is a **draft scaffold** for a data science team to refine -- it contains reasonable defaults and marks areas that need human judgment.
