# SESSION_NOTES-pointer-collapse.verify.sh — the proof for Session 246's COLLAPSE of the five
# oldest pointer blocks in SESSION_NOTES.md's front matter.
#
#   bash <this>              prove the collapse changed exactly what it declared, and nothing else
#   bash <this> --self-test  prove this proof can FAIL (46 mutants; exit 2 if any survives OR
#                            if any mutation turns out to have changed nothing -- Session 253)
#
# THIS IS NOT A TRIM AND NOT A SHARD PROOF. No record moved, no shard was written, no session was
# archived. Read `SESSION_NOTES-S241-through-S239.md.verify.sh` for the L-series; this file is a
# sibling of that lineage, not a member of it, and its assertions are lettered C0-C6 on purpose.
# Session 245 had to write a paragraph recording that its L14 was NOT the L14 a previous trim had
# drafted and rejected, so that a later trim would not resurrect the dead one believing it live. A
# second numbering costs nothing and removes that whole failure mode.
#
# WHAT THIS EXISTS TO PROVE. Operator ruling (a), 2026-08-25: Session 245 measured the retention
# rule's 1,050-line target converging on its four-record floor, projected the ninth trim at
# 1,101-1,248 lines while holding the floor, and put three remedies up. This is the chosen one --
# collapse 176 lines of frozen pointer prose into one table of cut keys and proof paths. (The
# removed size is derived by C0/SIZE; the added size is printed by a plain run, and is stated
# in no comment here -- the first draft said "42-line" and "17 mutants" and both were stale
# and read by nothing, which is this file's own subject matter and a review found them.)
#
# THE PREMISE THAT MADE IT SAFE WAS DERIVED, NOT INHERITED. Session 245 wrote that "each earlier
# proof reads its artifacts at its own commit, so compressing them disturbs nothing." That sentence
# is the entire justification for this deliverable and no assertion anywhere reads it. Session 246
# tested it: corrupt the fifth trim's block in the working tree, run all eight shard proofs -- all
# eight GREEN. Then the stronger form: corrupt the LIVE pointer block, the one that block and
# CLAUDE.md both call "the authority" -- its routing clause, its archived span and its size figures
# -- and all eight stay GREEN again. Every shard proof resolves its `before`/`after` from
# `git log --diff-filter=A` on its own shard and reads SESSION_NOTES.md at that commit; the
# working-tree copy is used only by the fallback branch that fires when a trim is not yet
# committed. So the premise holds, and it holds for a reason bigger than the premise:
#
#   FROM THE MOMENT A TRIM COMMIT LANDS, THE FRONT MATTER AN AGENT ACTUALLY OPENS IS READ BY
#   NOTHING. Fourteen assertions guard eight historical snapshots. The live file guards nothing.
#
# C6 is the first assertion in this repository to read that copy. It closes the hole for this table
# only -- deliberately: the general fix is a deliverable, not a side effect, and it is written out
# in Session 246's handoff rather than described.
#
# THE EIGHT ASSERTIONS
#
#   C0 PIN         OLD_BLOCKS -- the 176 removed lines, embedded below verbatim -- occurs exactly
#                  once in SESSION_NOTES.md at the declared pre-collapse commit, and is exactly 176
#                  lines. This is a PIN, not a derivation, and is labelled as one: the literal was
#                  generated from the artifact, so C0 cannot discover that the removal was wrong.
#                  What it does is make either copy impossible to change alone, which is the same
#                  service L6 performs for a shard banner. It also makes this file a second home
#                  for the removed prose, so "nothing was lost" does not rest on git alone.
#   C1 CONFINEMENT the post-collapse front matter is the pre-collapse front matter with exactly one
#                  OLD_BLOCKS -> NEW_TABLE replacement and the 3 declared substitutions, and
#                  nothing else. They are whole PARAGRAPHS, not fragments: a fragment substitution
#                  leaves the surrounding text wrapped for the sentence it replaced, and the first
#                  draft of this collapse shipped 132- and 153-character lines into a file hand-
#                  wrapped at 100 because of it. It also missed one falsified sentence entirely --
#                  the eighth block's "The seven blocks below" -- which paragraph-level anchors
#                  make hard to do, because the anchor IS the paragraph that has to stay true. Each substitution's anchor must occur exactly once in `before`
#                  (the L2/b0 lesson: a declaration that has gone stale against the file it claims
#                  to describe is worse than no declaration).
#   C2 RECORDS     the records zone is byte-identical across the collapse: same bytes, same order,
#                  same count, zero added. CLAUDE.md's two-commits rule says a trim commit carries
#                  no record edit; a collapse commit carries none either, and this is where that is
#                  enforced rather than promised.
#   C3 DERIVED     for each of the 5 rows: the archived record-heading count, the archived line
#                  count and the shard's total are MEASURED from that shard at its own add-commit,
#                  and the row's entire markdown line is then COMPOSED from the measurements and
#                  required to occur verbatim, exactly once, in NEW_TABLE. The table's figures are
#                  therefore derived rather than typed -- L12's lesson, taken one step further:
#                  L12 held declared integers against prose, C3 builds the prose from the integers.
#   C4 PROVENANCE  for each row: the declared trim sha IS the commit that added that shard; the
#                  declared "left live" span IS what SESSION_NOTES.md held at that commit; and both
#                  the shard and its .verify.sh exist on disk.
#   C5 ASSERTIONS  for each row: the assertion set that trim CONTRIBUTED, derived by parsing
#                  `^def L<N>(` out of that trim's proof AT ITS OWN ADD-COMMIT and subtracting its
#                  predecessor's set, equals the declared "added" column. Read at the add-commit,
#                  never from disk, for the reason L14 gives: L10 proves disk == add-commit, so
#                  reading disk would make this silently depend on L10 holding.
#   C6 LIVE        the WORKING TREE's SESSION_NOTES.md carries every composed table ROW exactly
#                  once and the table's opening line exactly once, and no longer contains
#                  OLD_BLOCKS. No L-series assertion reads the working-tree front matter; this one
#                  does, so the table stays guarded as the file grows and as later trims prepend
#                  blocks above it.
#                    PER ROW, NOT PER BLOCK, and a review is why. The first draft required the
#                    whole 48-line block verbatim. C1 pins that same literal against `after`, which
#                    artifacts() resolves at addcommit(SELF) -- FOREVER. So once a commit lands on
#                    top and amending is gone, ANY correction to the table's PROSE is red in one
#                    direction or the other: fix the file and C6 fails, fix the file and the
#                    literal and C1 fails. There was no green state containing a corrected table.
#                    Rows are the load-bearing half and C3 derives them, so C6 guards those and
#                    lets the prose be repaired the way this lineage repairs prose -- by a later
#                    session's declared substitution.
#   C7 COMPLETENESS every present-tense "**The N blocks below are frozen**" claim in the surviving
#                  front matter, with N DERIVED as the number of trim blocks that actually follow
#                  it. C1 gives confinement -- nothing changed beyond what was declared. It is
#                  silent on whether everything the collapse FALSIFIED was declared, and that list
#                  is hand-written. The first draft of this collapse proved the gap is real: it
#                  declared two members of that family and left the third, the eighth block's
#                  "**The seven blocks below**", standing and false with C0-C6 green. M42 is its
#                  mutant. This is L14/complete's argument in a different field: prove the list
#                  complete rather than assert it.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE. It does not prove the collapse was WISE -- that was the operator's call.
# It does not prove the surviving prose is TRUE. It does not re-prove any of the eight cuts: each
# has its own proof pinned to its own commit; run those too. And it says nothing about the rest of
# the front matter, which remains unguarded.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE NEUTER SWEEP, MEASURED AND PUBLISHED -- BOTH LEVELS. Session 245 shipped the whole-assertion
# loop and left the per-arm one outstanding, and said so in its header rather than publishing a
# stale table. Both were run here, on the committed artifacts, with the exit code checked every
# time: 0 or 2, never 1. An early-`return [...]` guard is neutered to `return []`, never to `pass`
# -- the non-type-preserving form is what silently reported sixty arms as unreachable in Session
# 245 and cost that session a finding.
#
#   WHOLE ASSERTION -- neuter one function at a time; every one of the eight is load-bearing:
#     C0 -> M20, M26, M36, M39, M40                C1 -> M3, M4, M5
#     C2 -> M7, M8                                 C3 -> M9-M11, M18, M25, M29, M37, M38, M41
#     C4 -> M21, M22, M24, M30, M45                C5 -> M19, M32, M33
#     C6 -> M16, M17, M34, M35, M43                C7 -> M44
#
#   PER ARM -- 35 failure-emitting `out.append` statements inside C0-C7; 17 uniquely catch a
#   mutant. TWENTY-SIX of the 46 mutants exist only because a sweep or a review found the arm they
#   cover unreachable, which is the whole argument for running both: M21-M25 gave C4 and C3/ROW
#   their first unique coverage; M26-M36 reached one guard each; M37-M44 came from an adversarial
#   review of a GREEN, twice-swept proof; M45-M46 restored coverage that the review's own new arms
#   had taken away.
#
#   THE 18 ARMS WITH NO UNIQUELY-CATCHING MUTANT, measured and grouped by cause. Do not trust this
#   list after editing anything -- it was re-measured four times in one session and moved each time.
#
#   * MUTANT TAKEN BY A SIBLING ADDED IN THE SAME REVISION -- the seventh trim named this shape
#     (L12/absent and L13/absent losing theirs to their own new siblings) and it recurred here
#     three ways. C3/SESSION and C3/ORDINAL: every mutation of a declared row field also changes
#     the line C3/ROW composes, so ROW fires alongside. C0/SIZE: M26 moves DECLARED_OLD_LINES, and
#     C0/FIGURE requires that same integer in the table's prose, so FIGURE fires with it.
#     C1/b0 ANCHOR and C1/b0 SUBSTITUTION: M27 and M28 duplicate a literal, which now duplicates
#     table rows too, so C3/SET fires. C4/LEFT-LIVE-unreadable: C3/SESSION reads the same blob.
#     C6/opening-line: M16 removes the whole table, so the per-row arm fires first.
#   * REACHABLE, NEVER ALONE -- guards that fire only in company: C3/unreadable (M29),
#     C3/no-headings, C5/no-`def L<N>` (M33), C7/unparseable-count-word (M46). Each is exercised;
#     none is the sole objector, because a world broken enough to reach it breaks a sibling too.
#   * PROVABLY SUBSUMED -- C1 TABLE MISSING: `want` contains the table by construction, so
#     CONFINEMENT must fire with it; it is a better message ahead of a byte-offset diff.
#     C2's three arms are mutually shadowing (RECORD ORDER is guarded by `if not out`, so exactly
#     one of the three always fires); C2 as a whole uniquely catches M7 and M8.
#   * C3/SET's two arms cover each other: an undeclared row is both un-composed and a count
#     mismatch. Kept as two because they name different causes on failure.
#
# A green --self-test whose mutants never exercise a new arm is the same lie as a green run. That
# sentence is this lineage's, and this proof is NOT the first to honour it: the SIXTH trim's arm
# sweep found two unreachable arms of its own, and the SEVENTH's published a full table -- 55 arms,
# 26 with a uniquely-catching mutant, 29 without, each of the 29 named with its reason. Read that
# table (SESSION_NOTES-S238-through-S236.md.verify.sh, under "TWENTY-NINE ARMS"); it is more
# thorough than this one and it is where the taxonomy of subsumed arms comes from. The EIGHTH trim
# is the one that dropped the discipline -- it shipped with the sweep outstanding and asked its
# successor to run it. This proof runs it, at both levels, for its own seven assertions.
#
# The seventh trim also measured a trap this sweep walked into and recovered from: the arm sweep is
# structurally blind to an early return ON SUCCESS, and neutering an early-return GUARD to `pass`
# rather than `return []` makes the run die instead of surviving -- which scores as "caught" and
# hides the arm. C6's `is MISSING` guard did exactly that here until the neuter was made
# type-preserving. That is the same defect Session 245 lost sixty arm results to.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SESSION 253 REPAIR -- M16 AND M17 MUTATED NOTHING FOR FOUR SESSIONS, AND THE PLAIN RUN NEVER SAW IT.
#
# Both mutated the working tree with `live_wt.replace(NEW_TABLE, ...)`. NEW_TABLE is 51 lines of
# TABLE plus PROSE, and prose in this file gets repaired: at `5243242` Session 249 corrected the
# read-cap sentence in the table's closing paragraph -- an entirely correct repair of a claim this
# lineage had itself measured false. From that commit `NEW_TABLE in live_wt` was False, both
# replacements returned their input unchanged, and C6 was handed PRISTINE bytes. C6 objected to
# nothing because nothing was wrong; both mutants "SURVIVED"; --self-test exited 2 from Session 249
# to Session 252 while `bash <this>` stayed GREEN, and nothing ran --self-test. Dated by bisecting
# `NEW_TABLE in git show <sha>:SESSION_NOTES.md`: last matched at b1d761f, broke at 5243242.
#
# THE LITERAL COULD NOT BE RE-PINNED, and that is measured, not assumed. C1 resolves `after` at
# THIS FILE'S OWN ADD-COMMIT (2b8c9c9) forever, and at that commit the file carries the OLD
# sentence. Re-pinning NEW_TABLE to today's text fails C1 TABLE MISSING and C1 CONFINEMENT at once
# -- there is no green state containing a re-pinned table. That is the same trap the C6 note above
# records for its own first draft, one field over. The BACKLOG's "re-pin one literal" is therefore
# not the repair; the mutants are, exactly as that item's last paragraph says.
#
# SO THE MUTATION MOVED TO WHAT C6 ACTUALLY READS: the COMPOSED ROWS and the table's OPENING LINE.
# Those cannot rot the same way, and the reason is structural rather than lucky -- C6's ORDINARY run
# asserts that each row and the opening line occur in the working tree exactly once, so any drift in
# what M16/M17 remove turns the PLAIN run red before it can disarm the self-test. The prose between
# them stays free to be repaired, which it will be: the ninth trim moves this front matter again.
#
# AND THE CLASS, NOT ONLY THE INSTANCE: a `str.replace` whose needle has drifted out of its haystack
# is SILENT. The driver now compares every mutant's argument tuple against the pristine one and
# reports NO-OP -- a distinct, hard failure -- for any mutant that changed nothing. What Session 252
# had to bisect for, the self-test now prints. The corollary for the other eight proofs is worth
# stating because it is cheap: a FULLY inert mutant always survives, since check() then receives
# pristine input and pristine input is green by definition -- so their passing --self-test already
# proves none of theirs is fully inert. A PARTIALLY inert mutant (one of two mutations landing) is
# invisible to that argument AND to this guard; it is filed in BACKLOG.md, not fixed here.
#
# NEITHER MODE SUBSUMES THE OTHER, measured this session with a control over all eight shards:
# append a line to a shard on disk and --self-test PASSES for every one of them -- because every
# mutant then fails for the corruption's sake and scores as "caught". The plain run catches all
# eight, but NOT always via the corrupted shard's own proof: that holds for six, while the S216 and
# S220 shards' own proofs stay green (they define only L0-L4, none of which reads disk) and the
# corruption is caught instead by L9 in every proof from the S227 one forward. So: --self-test
# proves the proof can fail; the plain run proves the world is intact; and the plain run is a
# LINEAGE-wide check, not a per-file one. Run BOTH, over every proof in the directory, in that
# order. The first draft of this paragraph said "that shard's proof" and a review measured 6 of 8.

[`docs/architecture-history/SESSION_NOTES-S231-through-S228.md`](docs/architecture-history/SESSION_NOTES-S231-through-S228.md)
— same shape, same newest-on-top order, frozen and byte-for-byte unedited. At that fifth cut
this live file was left holding Sessions 235 → 232 — four sessions, the floor `CLAUDE.md`
sets; the sixth trim above has since cut it again. Its proof is
[`SESSION_NOTES-S231-through-S228.md.verify.sh`](docs/architecture-history/SESSION_NOTES-S231-through-S228.md.verify.sh):
the ten assertions inherited from the fourth trim, one of them NARROWED, plus **L10** (every
ancestor shard's *proof script* held against a hand-declared freeze commit — L9 froze the shards and
left unguarded the four files that give those shards their provenance, so a weakened ancestor proof
leaves this whole suite green while five banners keep telling readers to run it) and **L11** (the
retention rule itself — that this cut fired above `CLAUDE.md`'s 1,500-line trigger, landed under its
1,050-line target and kept its 4-record floor, with those three numbers held against the sentence in
`CLAUDE.md` that declares them rather than carried as magic constants).

**The narrowed assertion is L2/b3, and it is the finding worth carrying forward.** Inherited, it
scanned the shard's *records* as well as its banner for leaked front-matter lines — and on this cut
it fires on a correct trim: front-matter line 54's link to the S224 shard is a substring of a line
inside Session 228's record, which this trim archives. Same text, two legitimate homes. The records
half of that scan can never produce a true positive, because **L1 pins those bytes**: anything
inserted into a record moves them and trips L1 first. A leak can only hide in the banner, which is
exactly where the fourth trim's b3 caught one. `body` is now the banner alone, the run still PRINTS
what the old predicate would have flagged, and b3 keeps a mutant nothing else catches.

**Five shards existed at that cut, and none was a prefix of any other.** The routing table that
stood here named those five and sent every session from 232 up to this live file; the sixth trim
falsified that last clause — Sessions 235 → 232 are in a shard now — and the table above replaces
it. `grep` the shards; `Read` none. **Shards stay write-once** — a sixth trim wrote a sixth file;
it did not append to one of those five.

**Three shard banners were stale at that cut; four are now.** The S220 shard's still says *"the
live ledger when N ≥ 221"*; the S224 shard's still routes Sessions 225 and up to this file; the
S227 shard's does the same for Sessions 228 and up; and the S231 shard's own prediction that it
would join them "at the sixth trim" has come true. All four were true at their own cut. The S220
proof predates L5; the S224, S227 and S231 proofs have L5 but read their artifacts at their own
trim commits, so none of the four can notice. **A shard banner is a snapshot of its own cut; this block is the
authority.**

**The sweep found five more unread copies, and re-derived beats inherited.** `CLAUDE.md` told the
fifth trim not to trust the fourth trim's list of copies. Re-running
`git grep -l 'SESSION_NOTES-'` confirmed the same four FILES but found five further live
count-carrying strings inside them that no assertion read: `CLAUDE.md`'s own section heading, its
"three newer shards" parenthetical, its "L5 reads three copies … L8 reads four more … All six
copies" census, `README.md`'s "write-once for all four shards" tail comment, and `BACKLOG.md`'s
plain-language index row — which states the shard census a second time, in different words from the
item it indexes. One of them was **already false before this trim ran**: `CLAUDE.md` said L8 covers
"the two prose copies" three lines after saying it "reads four more", and the shipped `REACH` had
four entries. All five are declared in **L8** now. **Sweep again at the sixth trim rather than
trusting this list either.**

**The four blocks below are frozen at the FOURTH, THIRD, SECOND and FIRST trims and describe THOSE
cuts.** This trim falsified exactly three passages of the fourth trim's block — its claim about
which sessions this live file holds, its whole routing paragraph, and its count of how many shard
banners are stale — and rewrote all three as declared substitutions the proof checks by exact
equality. Every other byte of that block is original, and the third, second and first trims' blocks
are untouched. Each earlier proof reads its artifacts from the commit that added its own shard, so
this trim cannot disturb any of them; all four were re-run green at this cut, and a session that
doubts that should run them rather than reason about it.

**Fourth trim (Session 231). Archived Sessions 227 → 225 — 3 record headings, 738 lines** into
[`docs/architecture-history/SESSION_NOTES-S227-through-S225.md`](docs/architecture-history/SESSION_NOTES-S227-through-S225.md)
— same shape, same newest-on-top order, frozen and byte-for-byte unedited. At that fourth cut
this live file was left holding Sessions 231 → 228 — four sessions, the floor `CLAUDE.md`
sets; the fifth trim above has since cut it again. Its proof is
[`SESSION_NOTES-S227-through-S225.md.verify.sh`](docs/architecture-history/SESSION_NOTES-S227-through-S225.md.verify.sh):
the eight assertions inherited from the third trim plus **L8** (the three copies of the shard set
that no earlier proof could reach — `README.md`'s repo map, the shard-naming rule in
`docs/methodology/PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md`, and `BACKLOG.md`'s read-cap item, which the third trim's
own sentence did not know was making the same claim — **and `CLAUDE.md`'s prose**, whose routing
table L5 always parsed while its *"there are THREE"* count words were read by nothing) and **L9**
(write-once enforced for
**every** shard on disk, not only the newest — L7 has only ever guarded the shard it shipped with,
so the S216 and S220 shards have never had any enforcement at all, and the S224 shard's lives only
inside its own proof, which nothing obliges a session to run).

**Four shards existed at that cut, and none was a prefix of any other.** The routing table that
stood here named those four and sent every session from 228 up to this live file; the fifth trim
falsified that last clause — Sessions 231 → 228 are in a shard now — and the table above replaces
it. `grep` the shards; `Read` none. **Shards stay write-once** — a fifth trim wrote a fifth file;
it did not append to one of those four.

**Two shard banners were stale at that cut; three are now.** The S220 shard's still says *"the
live ledger when N ≥ 221"*; the S224 shard's still routes Sessions 225 and up to this file; and
the S227 shard's own prediction that it would join them "at the fifth trim" has come true. All
three were true at their own cut. The S220 proof predates L5 and cannot notice; the S224 and S227
proofs have L5 but read their artifacts at their own trim commits, so neither can notice either. **A shard banner is a snapshot of its own cut; this block is the authority.** What is
no longer true is that `README.md` and `docs/methodology/PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md` sit beyond every
proof's reach: **L8 holds them — and `BACKLOG.md` with them**, a third copy that sentence never
named, found by sweeping for the class instead of trusting the list. **Sweep again at the fifth
trim rather than trusting this list either**; `git grep -l 'SESSION_NOTES-'` is the whole sweep and
it takes a second. A fifth trim that leaves any of the four files L8 reads alone fails a proof
instead of quietly shipping a lie.

**The three blocks below are frozen at the THIRD, SECOND and FIRST trims and describe THOSE cuts.**
This trim falsified exactly four passages of the third trim's block — its claim about which sessions
this live file holds, its whole routing paragraph, the sentence putting `README.md` and
`PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md` beyond every proof's reach, and its parenthetical calling **L7** the only
enforcement write-once has ever had, which **L9** has now made false — and rewrote all four as
declared substitutions the proof checks by exact equality. Every other byte of that block is original, and the second and first trims' blocks
are untouched. Each earlier proof reads its artifacts from the commit that added its own shard, so
this trim cannot disturb any of them; all three were re-run green at this cut, and a session that
doubts that should run them rather than reason about it.

**Third trim (Session 228). Archived Sessions 224 → 221 — 4 record headings, 891 lines** into
[`docs/architecture-history/SESSION_NOTES-S224-through-S221.md`](docs/architecture-history/SESSION_NOTES-S224-through-S221.md)
— same shape, same newest-on-top order, frozen and byte-for-byte unedited. At that third cut
this live file was left holding Sessions 228 → 225 — four sessions, the floor `CLAUDE.md`
sets; the fourth trim above has since cut it again. Its proof is
[`SESSION_NOTES-S224-through-S221.md.verify.sh`](docs/architecture-history/SESSION_NOTES-S224-through-S221.md.verify.sh):
the five inherited assertions plus **L5** (the table below, clause by clause — the numbers against
the cut key, the filenames against what those files actually hold), **L6** (the shard's banner
pinned byte-for-byte) and **L7** (that shard still being, on disk today, the bytes the proof was
written about — which was, until the fourth trim's **L9** extended the same check to every older
shard, the only enforcement `write-once` had ever had).

**Three shards existed at that cut, and none was a prefix of any other.** The routing table that
stood here named those three and sent every session from 225 up to this live file; the fourth trim
falsified that last clause — Sessions 227 → 225 are in a shard now — and the table above replaces
it. `grep` the shards; `Read` none. **Shards stay write-once** — a fourth trim wrote a fourth file;
it did not append to one of those three.

**A copy of that table inside a write-once file goes stale at the next cut and cannot be repaired.**
The S220 shard's banner still says *"the live ledger when N ≥ 221"*, which this trim falsified; its
proof predates L5 and will never notice. Treat every shard banner as a snapshot of its own cut. Two
further copies were named here as outside every proof — `README.md`'s repo map and the shard-naming
rule in `docs/methodology/PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md` — and a trim that left either alone shipped a lie.
There was a third nobody had named: `BACKLOG.md`'s read-cap item, carrying the same count. The
fourth trim's **L8** checks all three.

**The two blocks below are frozen at the SECOND and FIRST trims and describe THOSE cuts.** This
trim falsified exactly two sentences of the second trim's block — its claim about which sessions
this live file holds, and its whole routing paragraph — and rewrote both as declared substitutions
the proof checks by exact equality. Every other byte of that block is original, and the first
trim's block is untouched. Each earlier proof reads its artifacts from the commit that added its
own shard, so this trim cannot disturb either; both were re-run green at this cut, and a session
that doubts that should run them rather than reason about it.

**Second trim (Session 224). Archived Sessions 220 → 217 — 5 record headings, 774 lines** into
[`docs/architecture-history/SESSION_NOTES-S220-through-S217.md`](docs/architecture-history/SESSION_NOTES-S220-through-S217.md)
— same shape, same newest-on-top order, frozen and byte-for-byte unedited. At that second cut
this live file was left holding Sessions 224 → 221 — four sessions, the floor `CLAUDE.md`
sets; the third trim above has since cut it again. Its proof is
[`SESSION_NOTES-S220-through-S217.md.verify.sh`](docs/architecture-history/SESSION_NOTES-S220-through-S217.md.verify.sh):
four inherited assertions plus an L4 pinning the cut point, its own key, its own `--self-test`.

**Two shards existed at that cut, and neither was a prefix of the other.** The routing table that
stood here named only those two and sent everything newer to this live file; the third trim
falsified every clause of it, and the table above replaces it. `grep` the shards; `Read` none.
**Shards are write-once** — a third trim writes a third file, it does not append.

**The block immediately below is frozen at the FIRST trim and describes THAT cut, not this one.**
This trim falsified exactly two of its sentences and rewrote both, as declared substitutions the
proof checks by exact equality; every other byte of that block is original. They were: its claim
that this live file holds Sessions 222 → 217, and its claim that Session 216's handoff evaluation
"stayed here" — Session 217's record, which carries that evaluation, is now in the S220 shard. That
block's own proof reads its artifacts from commit `a9510ca`, so this trim cannot disturb it; it
still runs green today, and a session that doubts that should run it rather than reason about it.

**Archived Sessions 216 → 1 — 206 record headings, 24,564 lines** into
[`docs/architecture-history/SESSION_NOTES-through-S216.md`](docs/architecture-history/SESSION_NOTES-through-S216.md)
— same format, same newest-on-top order, frozen, byte-for-byte unedited. At that first cut this
live file was left holding Sessions 222 → 217; the second trim above has since cut it again.

**`grep` that shard; never `Read` it.** It is 24,564 lines — an agent `Read` truncates at 2,000
lines with no error and no missing-data marker, which is the defect this archive exists to remove.
Nothing watches the shard for that (`methodology_dashboard.py`'s `READ_CAP_WATCHED` is an exact-path
set holding only `SESSION_NOTES.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `HANDOFFS.md` and the backlog locations), so
this paragraph is the only warning there is.

**Losslessness is proved, not asserted.** Run
[`docs/architecture-history/SESSION_NOTES-through-S216.md.verify.sh`](docs/architecture-history/SESSION_NOTES-through-S216.md.verify.sh)
— it re-derives L0 (footer declaration), L1 (records-zone concatenation), L2 (zone pinning) and L3
(record partition) from git, and exits non-zero on failure; `--self-test` proves the proof itself can
fail. Do not trust this sentence, and do not trust a digest — run it. **The cut is by byte position,
not by authorship:** Session 216's own handoff evaluation is filed inside Session 217's record,
because this file files an evaluation under its author. Expect that seam at every trim boundary.

"""

NEW_TABLE = """**The first five trims are one table now (Session 246).** Their pointer blocks stood here — 176
lines, the fifth trim's down to the first's — until the front matter became the half of this file
that grows: Session 245 measured the retention rule's 1,050-line target converging on its four-record
floor, put three remedies to the operator, and this is the one chosen. **Nothing was archived and no
record moved.** Each collapsed block is still readable byte-for-byte in two places — at commit
`ddd5660`, and embedded verbatim in the proof named below, which asserts those two are equal. Every
measurement in the table — every span, count, line total, trim commit and assertion credit — is
DERIVED from the artifacts at their own add-commits, and the proof COMPOSES each row's line from
those measurements rather than comparing against it. Two fields are declarations the proof checks
rather than measurements it takes: the ordinal, which is definitional, and the trim's session
number, which it re-derives as the newest record this file held at that commit.

*`archived` is the session span that left this file and `rec` how many record headings went with it;
`lines`, the lines they took; `shard`, that file's total; `left live`, what this file was left
holding at that cut; `added`, the assertions that trim contributed to the inherited set. Each
shard's proof is its own path with `.verify.sh` appended.*

The proof is
[`SESSION_NOTES-pointer-collapse.verify.sh`](docs/architecture-history/SESSION_NOTES-pointer-collapse.verify.sh),
and its assertions are lettered **C0–C6** rather than numbered: this is not a trim, they are not the
`L`-series, and Session 245 had to record an `L14` collision to stop a later trim resurrecting a
rejected assertion under a live name. **C6 holds this table against the WORKING TREE; no `L`-series
assertion holds any PROSE against it** — which is the finding worth carrying forward on its own.
Every shard proof resolves its prose operands from its own trim commit: the live file *and*
`CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `BACKLOG.md` and `PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md` are all read as they stood
**then**. What the `L`-series does read from disk is the shards and the proof scripts, by `L7`,
`L9` and `L10` — bytes, not claims. So the moment a trim lands, every
prose copy this apparatus exists to keep in step stops being checked — this front matter, the block
above that calls itself "the authority", and all four files `L8` reaches. Session 246 measured it,
with a control: corrupt the live pointer block's routing clause and figures, or `CLAUDE.md`'s shard
census, or `BACKLOG.md`'s, or `PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md`'s, and all eight proofs stay green; edit an
ancestor shard on disk and they go red. Session 245's gotcha 2 — that those four are read *live* —
held only while its own trim was uncommitted. C6 closes this for the table above and nothing else.
**The rest is the ninth trim's, and it is the largest hole this lineage has.**

**Cutting is by byte position, never by authorship.** This ledger files a handoff evaluation under
its author, so Session N's evaluation of N−1 sits inside N's record and every cut so far has split
one from its subject. Expect that seam at every boundary. What these five trims found, argued and
rejected stays in their own blocks at the commits above; what they left BINDING is in `CLAUDE.md`'s
two `SESSION_NOTES.md`-is-trimmed bullets, which no collapse touches. **`grep` the shards; `Read`
none** — the first is 24,590 lines, an agent `Read` stops at 2,000 with no error and no marker, and
nothing watches any of them.
