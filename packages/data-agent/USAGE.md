# model-project-constructor-data-agent

A standalone Data Agent that turns a structured data request into executed SQL
queries, quality-check results, and a narrative `DataReport`. Distributed as a
separate Python package so analyst teams can use it outside the full
`model-project-constructor` pipeline.

The Data Agent has exactly one public entry point:

```python
DataAgent(llm, db).run(request) -> DataReport
```

It has three supported usage modes: the `model-data-agent` CLI, Python in a
script, and Python in a notebook. All three construct a `DataRequest`, hand
it to `DataAgent.run`, and receive a `DataReport`. See architecture-plan.md §7
for the design rationale.

## Installation

```bash
# From the monorepo checkout:
uv pip install -e packages/data-agent

# As a standalone distribution (once published):
pip install model-project-constructor-data-agent
```

Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your environment before using the default
`AnthropicLLMClient`:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
```

## Example 1 — CLI

Write a `request.json` matching the `DataRequest` schema:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0.0",
  "target_description": "subrogation recovery amount on TX auto claims",
  "target_granularity": {"unit": "claim", "time_grain": "event"},
  "required_features": ["paid_amount", "state", "loss_date"],
  "population_filter": "TX auto claims with loss in 2024",
  "time_range": "2024-01-01 to 2024-12-31",
  "database_hint": "claims",
  "source": "standalone",
  "source_ref": "analyst-request-2026-04-14"
}
```

Then run:

```bash
model-data-agent run \
    --request request.json \
    --output report.json \
    --db-url "postgresql+psycopg://readonly_user@db.internal/claims"
```

Options:
- `--db-url` is optional; if omitted, quality checks are generated but not
  executed, and each is marked `NOT_EXECUTED` in the report.
- `--model` overrides the default Claude model (default is a fast/economical
  Sonnet build).
- `--fake-llm` substitutes a deterministic stub and is intended for smoke
  tests only — it does not produce real analysis.

The CLI exits 0 on success and writes the `DataReport` as indented JSON to the
path given by `--output`. The terminal prints a single confirmation line with
the report's `status`.

## Example 2 — Python in a script

```python
from model_project_constructor_data_agent import (
    DataAgent,
    DataGranularity,
    DataRequest,
    ReadOnlyDB,
)
from model_project_constructor_data_agent.anthropic_client import AnthropicLLMClient

request = DataRequest(
    target_description="subrogation recovery amount on TX auto claims",
    target_granularity=DataGranularity(unit="claim", time_grain="event"),
    required_features=["paid_amount", "state", "loss_date"],
    population_filter="TX auto claims with loss in 2024",
    time_range="2024-01-01 to 2024-12-31",
    database_hint="claims",
    source="standalone",
    source_ref="analyst-script-2026-04-14",
)

llm = AnthropicLLMClient()  # reads ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
db = ReadOnlyDB("postgresql+psycopg://readonly_user@db.internal/claims")

agent = DataAgent(llm=llm, db=db)
report = agent.run(request)

print(report.status)
print(report.summary)
for pq in report.primary_queries:
    print(f"  {pq.name}: {pq.expected_row_count_order} rows expected")
    for qc in pq.quality_checks:
        print(f"    [{qc.execution_status}] {qc.check_name}")
```

Handle the three possible statuses explicitly:

```python
if report.status == "COMPLETE":
    save_to_results_table(report)
elif report.status == "INCOMPLETE_REQUEST":
    raise ValueError(f"request was vacuous: {report.data_quality_concerns}")
elif report.status == "EXECUTION_FAILED":
    log.error(f"data agent failed: {report.summary}")
```

The agent **never raises** for expected failure modes — every failure is
returned as a valid `DataReport` with `status` ∈
{`COMPLETE`, `INCOMPLETE_REQUEST`, `EXECUTION_FAILED`}. Callers can treat
`run()` as total for these three outcomes.

## Example 3 — Python in a notebook

Same API, with the typical notebook ergonomics. Persist the report to disk so
you can reload it without re-running the LLM.

```python
from pathlib import Path
import json

from model_project_constructor_data_agent import (
    DataAgent,
    DataGranularity,
    DataReport,
    DataRequest,
    ReadOnlyDB,
)
from model_project_constructor_data_agent.anthropic_client import AnthropicLLMClient

# Cell 1 — build and run
request = DataRequest(
    target_description="subrogation recovery amount on TX auto claims",
    target_granularity=DataGranularity(unit="claim", time_grain="event"),
    required_features=["paid_amount", "state", "loss_date"],
    population_filter="TX auto claims with loss in 2024",
    time_range="2024-01-01 to 2024-12-31",
    database_hint="claims",
    source="standalone",
    source_ref="analyst-notebook-2026-04-14",
)

agent = DataAgent(
    llm=AnthropicLLMClient(),
    db=ReadOnlyDB("sqlite:///claims.db"),
)
report = agent.run(request)

# Cell 2 — persist so you can reload without paying LLM tokens again
Path("report.json").write_text(json.dumps(report.model_dump(mode="json"), indent=2))

# Cell 3 — reload on a subsequent run of the notebook
report = DataReport.model_validate(json.loads(Path("report.json").read_text()))

# Cell 4 — explore
import pandas as pd
rows = [
    {
        "query": pq.name,
        "check": qc.check_name,
        "status": qc.execution_status,
        "summary": qc.result_summary,
    }
    for pq in report.primary_queries
    for qc in pq.quality_checks
]
pd.DataFrame(rows)
```

## Example 4 — Data-source discovery (`discover` CLI)

The package ships a reference producer for the data-source-inventory contract
that probes a live database's `information_schema` and emits a valid
`DataSourceInventory` JSON file. Useful as a standalone analyst tool (Phase 2
of the inventory plan) and as a building block for automated pipeline flows.

```bash
# Discover every accessible schema except information_schema / pg_catalog:
model-data-agent discover \
    --db-url "postgresql+psycopg://readonly_user@db.internal/claims" \
    --output inventory.json

# Limit to specific schemas (repeatable flag):
model-data-agent discover \
    --db-url "postgresql+psycopg://readonly_user@db.internal/claims" \
    --output inventory.json \
    --include-schemas public \
    --include-schemas claims_domain

# Ask the LLM to rank each discovered table's relevance to a request context:
model-data-agent discover \
    --db-url "postgresql+psycopg://readonly_user@db.internal/claims" \
    --output inventory.json \
    --rank-with-llm \
    --request-context "subrogation recovery classifier"
```

The command writes a JSON file conforming to `DataSourceInventory` and
exits 0 with a one-line confirmation (`wrote inventory.json (N entries)`).
(It exits non-zero and writes nothing when the database cannot be connected to
or the LLM client cannot be constructed.)

Two outcomes are **degraded**: the file is still written — it conforms to the
contract and keeps whatever was reflected — and the command **exits 1**, with
one `error:` line on stderr, so `discover ... && next-step` can tell a degraded
inventory from a good one. The single `ProducerMetadata.notes` field says which;
it is `null` on a healthy run.

- **Reflection fails** (permission denied, unsupported dialect, one table or
  view that cannot be reflected, or reflected text — a name, a column type —
  that cannot be written as UTF-8): `entries` is empty and `notes` begins
  `information_schema probe failed:` followed by the error's type and message,
  on one line, with any URL password masked (best-effort).
- **`--rank-with-llm` was requested and ranking fails** (no credentials, a
  malformed or truncated reply, a reply that names none of the discovered
  tables exactly, a score that is not a finite number from 0.0 to 1.0 on a
  table it names, or a reason that cannot be written as UTF-8): the reflected
  tables are **kept, all unranked**, and `notes` begins `LLM relevance ranking
  failed` and names the error's **type only** — the message is never written
  to the file, which travels downstream. The type says which: for the three
  replies above it is `RankingMatchedNoEntryError`,
  `InvalidRelevanceScoreError` or `UnwritableEntryError`. A score is rejected,
  never clamped — a reply on a 0–10 scale would clamp to all 1.0 and lose its
  order. A reply that ranks only some of the tables is **not** a failure: the
  rest stay unranked.

Both also log one WARNING, carrying the cause, on the
`model_project_constructor_data_agent.discovery` logger — with no logging
configured that is a line on stderr.

Exit 1 for a degraded inventory is an operator ruling of Session 261. Before it,
a reflection error of a type the probe anticipated exited **0** with the empty
inventory; any other reflection error, and every ranking failure, was a
traceback and **no file**.

The same behavior is available in Python via `probe_information_schema`:

```python
from model_project_constructor_data_agent import (
    ReadOnlyDB,
    probe_information_schema,
)

db = ReadOnlyDB("postgresql+psycopg://readonly_user@db.internal/claims")
db.connect()
try:
    inventory = probe_information_schema(
        db,
        include_schemas=["public"],
        request_context="subrogation recovery model",
    )
finally:
    db.close()

print(f"{len(inventory.entries)} tables/views discovered")
```

## Example 5 — Inventory-aware run (consumer integration)

A `DataRequest` accepts an optional `data_source_inventory: DataSourceInventory`
field. When set, the agent renders a summarized inventory block into the
query-generation prompt so the LLM prefers inventory-named tables over
inventing ones, and records which entries were referenced per query under
`PrimaryQuery.inventory_entries_used`.

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

from model_project_constructor_data_agent import (
    DataAgent,
    DataGranularity,
    DataRequest,
    DataSourceInventory,
    ReadOnlyDB,
)
from model_project_constructor_data_agent.anthropic_client import AnthropicLLMClient

inventory = DataSourceInventory.model_validate(
    json.loads(Path("curated_inventory.json").read_text())
)

request = DataRequest(
    target_description="subrogation recovery amount on TX auto claims",
    target_granularity=DataGranularity(unit="claim", time_grain="event"),
    required_features=["paid_amount", "state", "loss_date"],
    population_filter="TX auto claims with loss in 2024",
    time_range="2024-01-01 to 2024-12-31",
    source="standalone",
    source_ref="analyst-2026-04-19",
    data_source_inventory=inventory,
)

db = ReadOnlyDB("postgresql+psycopg://readonly_user@db.internal/claims")

report = DataAgent(
    # Tell the model which dialect it is writing for — see "SQL dialect" below.
    llm=AnthropicLLMClient(sql_dialect=db.dialect),
    db=db,
).run(request)

for pq in report.primary_queries:
    print(f"{pq.name} referenced: {pq.inventory_entries_used}")
```

### SQL dialect

`AnthropicLLMClient(sql_dialect=...)` (and `make_llm_client(..., sql_dialect=...)`)
names the dialect the generated SQL must execute on. **Pass it whenever you pass
a `db`.** Without it the model is left to infer the dialect and infers a
*warehouse*: a live A/B on the eval corpus (Session 217, one model, one session)
had the dialect-blind prompt produce 2 of 5 executable queries against SQLite —
the failures being `DATEDIFF`, `PERCENTILE_CONT … WITHIN GROUP` and `ILIKE` —
against 4 of 4 with the dialect named. The SQL still *parses* either way, so an
unstated dialect fails late, at execution.

Derive it rather than hardcoding it:

```python
from model_project_constructor_data_agent.db import ReadOnlyDB, sql_dialect_from_url

db = ReadOnlyDB(url)
client = AnthropicLLMClient(sql_dialect=db.dialect)      # from the DB object
client = AnthropicLLMClient(sql_dialect=sql_dialect_from_url(url))  # or the URL
```

Both parse the URL string only — no connection and no installed driver is
required, so the dialect is available before the first query is generated (the
DB is not connected until the QC-execution stage). An unparseable URL yields
`None`, and `None` reproduces the dialect-silent prompt exactly. It also logs a
WARNING on the `model_project_constructor_data_agent.db` logger naming the parse
failure, so a URL that does not PARSE is distinguishable from one that parses
and cannot be connected to — the second is reported in the `DataReport` instead. The `model-data-agent`
CLI and `scripts/run_pipeline.py` derive it from `--db-url` automatically; only
direct library callers need to pass it themselves.

Precedence rules when both `database_hint` and `data_source_inventory` are
set: the inventory wins (richer signal subsumes the hint); the hint is still
passed as context. An inventory with `entries=[]` is treated identically to
`data_source_inventory=None`. See
`docs/architecture-history/data-source-inventory-contract-plan.md` §6.3 for the full
table.

Large inventories are truncated in the prompt: entries are sorted by
`relevance_score` (unset → 0.0) and the top 20 are emitted; a trailing
`... and M more sources truncated` note accounts for the remainder. Per-field
content (`description`, `relevance_reason`) has control characters stripped
and is bounded to 2000 characters.

## Public API

All names below are importable from the top-level package:

from model_project_constructor_data_agent import (
    DataAgent,           # the agent class
    DataGranularity,     # schema: unit + time_grain
    DataReport,          # schema: complete output

    SummaryResult,       # intermediate dataclass returned by LLMClient
    TableRanking,        # intermediate dataclass for LLM-ranked discovery results
    DBConnectionError,   # exception
)
from model_project_constructor_data_agent.anthropic_client import (
    AnthropicLLMClient,
    LLMParseError,
)
```

## Data source inventory

The data agent accepts an optional `DataSourceInventory` describing which
tables / views / datasets are relevant to a `DataRequest`. The inventory is a
plug-in contract: discovery (identifying sources) is a separate activity,
and multiple producer classes populate the same consumer shape:

- **Curated** — hand-maintained JSON/YAML files from teams that already know
  their canonical tables and factors. No code required.
- **Automated** — probes like `information_schema` against a live DB
  (reference implementation shipped; see Example 4).
- **Interview** — converter from stakeholder-named systems captured by the
  intake agent (Guidewire, Duck Creek, etc.) into inventory entries with
  `producer_type="interview"`. Shipped Phase 4 as
  `intake_qa_pairs_to_inventory` in `orchestrator/adapters.py`; lives in the
  orchestrator package, not data-agent (see the Decoupling guarantee below) —
  the wiki Pipeline-Overview describes how the orchestrator wires it in.
- **External catalog** — DataHub, Amundsen, Collibra, and similar metadata
  catalogs (future).

Phase 1 shipped the schema. Phase 2 shipped the `information_schema` reference
producer (Example 4): `probe_information_schema` + `model-data-agent discover`
+ `ReadOnlyDB.get_information_schema`. Phase 3 (shipped) plumbs
`DataRequest.data_source_inventory` through to the query-generation prompt —
see Example 5. Phase 4 (shipped) wires the orchestrator's
`--inventory-from-intake` flag in `scripts/run_pipeline.py` to the
`intake_qa_pairs_to_inventory` converter, deriving an interview-producer
inventory from `IntakeReport.qa_pairs` (orchestrator-side; see the wiki
Pipeline-Overview for the pipeline-mode flow). Callers who do not set the
field continue to work unchanged. See
`docs/architecture-history/data-source-inventory-contract-plan.md` for the full plan
and `tests/fixtures/sample_curated_inventory.json` for a valid
curated-producer example.

## Error contract

- `DataAgent.run()` never raises for expected failure modes.
- Unexpected exceptions inside the graph are caught at the outer boundary and
  surfaced as `DataReport(status="EXECUTION_FAILED")`.
- `AnthropicLLMClient` raises `LLMParseError` on unparseable Claude output;
  this propagates through the outer boundary and becomes `EXECUTION_FAILED`.
- `ReadOnlyDB.connect()` raises `DBConnectionError` on connect failure;
  `DataAgent` catches it, routes the QC stage to `NOT_EXECUTED`, and appends the
  error text — with any URL password masked — to
  `DataReport.data_quality_concerns`, so the operator can tell a malformed URL
  from a database that is down. The report status stays `COMPLETE`.
- `probe_information_schema()` lets no `Exception` raised by the `db` or the
  `llm` escape: a reflection failure returns an empty inventory, a ranking
  failure returns the reflected entries unranked, and `notes` labels each
  (Example 4). A non-`str` `request_context` still raises. `notes` being `null`
  does not mean every entry is ranked — a ranker that simply returns no ranking
  for a table raises nothing — but when a ranker ran, it does mean at least one
  entry is ranked and every score applied is a finite number from 0.0 to 1.0.
  The library never exits; turning a degraded inventory into exit 1 is the
  `discover` command's job.

## Decoupling guarantee

This package has zero runtime dependency on the main
`model_project_constructor` package. It cannot import `IntakeReport` or any
intake-side code. A CI test (`tests/test_data_agent_decoupling.py`) AST-walks
every module here and fails the build on any `import` that references the
intake schema. See architecture-plan.md §7 for details.
