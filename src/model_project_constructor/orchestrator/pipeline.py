"""Sequential pipeline driver (architecture-plan §12 + §14 Phase 5).

``run_pipeline`` is the single public entry point. It takes a
:class:`PipelineConfig` and three agent runners (callables — not concrete
agent classes — so tests can inject stubs without instantiating LLM
clients or databases), drives the Intake → Data → Website sequence, and
halts on the first ``status != "COMPLETE"``.

Every inter-agent handoff is wrapped in a :class:`HandoffEnvelope` and
persisted via :class:`CheckpointStore`. The orchestrator itself is the
envelope's ``source_agent`` when it is forwarding one agent's output to
the next; only the Website Agent's result envelope has
``source_agent="website"`` because that handoff terminates the run (it
comes back to the orchestrator).

Per §12 the orchestrator does not retry failed agents — a non-COMPLETE
status halts the run and the caller inspects ``PipelineResult`` to
decide whether to re-run with a fresh ``run_id`` or investigate.
