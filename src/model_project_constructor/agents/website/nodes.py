"""Website Agent graph nodes.

Phase 4A shipped three nodes (``CREATE_PROJECT`` → ``SCAFFOLD_BASE`` →
``INITIAL_COMMITS``). Phase 4B layers in:

- ``SCAFFOLD_GOVERNANCE`` — governance artifacts per §8.2 (tier-gated)
- ``SCAFFOLD_ANALYSIS`` — governance-driven analysis scaffolds (fairness)
- ``SCAFFOLD_TESTS`` — governance-driven test scaffolds (fairness)
- A ``RETRY_BACKOFF`` self-loop off ``INITIAL_COMMITS`` for any
  ``RepoClientError`` (a transient HTTP 401/429/5xx, but also a reply of the
  wrong shape, which will probably recur), 3 attempts max with
  exponential delay.

All scaffold nodes merge into ``state["files_pending"]``; none replace it.
``INITIAL_COMMITS`` is the single flush point, so retrying it safely
re-delivers the whole pending dict in one call.

None of these nodes call ``interrupt()`` — the website agent is headless.
Each node is a pure function over state + the injected ``RepoClient``
(plus an injectable ``sleep`` function for test-time determinism on the
retry path).
