"""Hold the four prose files against the shard files on disk, on every CI run.

WHY THIS EXISTS (Session 247, closing Session 246's what's-next #1).

``SESSION_NOTES.md`` is trimmed periodically: retired records move into frozen,
write-once shards under ``docs/architecture-history/``, each beside a
``.verify.sh`` proof. Those proofs carry ``L``-assertions that hold four
prose files -- ``CLAUDE.md``, ``README.md``, ``BACKLOG.md`` and
``docs/methodology/PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md`` -- against the shard set.

**But every one of them resolves its prose operands from its OWN trim commit**
(``blob("%s:%s" % (sha, path))``). Only the shards and the proof scripts are read
from disk. Session 246 measured this with a control: corrupt any of the four
files in the working tree and all nine proofs stay GREEN; edit an ancestor shard
on disk and they go RED. So from the moment a trim commit lands, **no prose copy
the apparatus exists to keep in step is checked by anything** until the next trim
-- and 33 of the 42 commits that have touched these files since the first trim
fell in such a window.

Measured evidence that the gap is real, not theoretical: of the 19 literals the
SEVENTH trim's proof requires in these files, only **3** are still present in the
working tree. The eighth trim legitimately rewrote the rest. That proof is green
because it reads them at its own commit.

THE DESIGN, AND THE TWO RULINGS BEHIND IT (operator, 2026-08-25)

1. **pytest-in-CI, not another standalone ``.verify.sh``.** ``uv run pytest -q``
   already runs on every push and pull request, so this needs no ``ci.yml``
   change. It also means the guard must NOT touch git: ``actions/checkout@v4``
   is used here without ``fetch-depth``, i.e. a depth-1 shallow clone, so a
   git-derived fact would behave differently in CI than on a developer machine.
   **Everything below is derived from files on disk.**

2. **Fail-closed allowlist, not region markers.** Region markers would make a
   census claim written OUTSIDE a marked region invisible -- the same hole,
   relocated. Here every number token near shard vocabulary is in scope BY
   DEFAULT and must be either composed from the shards or explicitly frozen in
   ``FROZEN``. Forgetting is the failure mode this lineage keeps hitting
   (learnings #126, #186, #188), and only fail-closed catches forgetting.

Computed fields (Quarto ``.qmd``) were considered and ruled out: ``CLAUDE.md`` is
loaded raw by the agent harness, every session hand-edits these files, and eight
write-once proofs match literal byte strings inside them. More fundamentally a
computed field is fail-OPEN -- it fixes the numbers an author remembered to
template, and every incident here has been a number nobody noticed.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT GUARANTEED

``test_composed_census_claims_are_present`` COMPOSES each expected sentence from
the measured shards rather than comparing a declared integer against the prose
(learning #196), so a failure prints the exact sentence the file must contain.

``test_every_number_near_shard_vocabulary_is_classified`` is the fail-closed net.
It is fail-closed **for the claim shapes it scans** -- a number within
``WINDOW`` characters of "shard", or quantifying a shard-set head noun. A census
claim written with none of that vocabulary is NOT caught; that is the residual
hole and it is named here rather than papered over (learning #175).

Every entry in ``FROZEN`` is a per-OCCURRENCE string, never a whole-file
exemption: learning #135 records that exempting a file lets every live line
inside it ride in free.

NEUTER LOOP, published rather than merely run (learnings #125, #141, #198). Remove one
check; do any mutants then survive?  Re-derived after the last edit to this file.

    check_tiling         LOAD-BEARING, sole catcher of M16
    check_proofs         LOAD-BEARING, sole catcher of M14
    check_banners        LOAD-BEARING, sole catcher of M17
    check_composed       LOAD-BEARING, sole catcher of M03, M05, M06, M08, M11, M12, M15
    check_filename_sets  LOAD-BEARING, sole catcher of M02
    check_scan           LOAD-BEARING, sole catcher of M09
    check_frozen         LOAD-BEARING, sole catcher of M10

    mutants: 17      checks: 7      survivors with all checks present: none

M16 and M17 exist only to isolate check_tiling and check_banners. Every other way of
breaking a span or a banner also makes the prose disagree with the filenames, so
check_composed catches it first and those two could be deleted with the suite still
green. Both mutants therefore make the MISTAKE CONSISTENT -- they rewrite all four
prose files to agree with the broken tree -- which is the realistic failure: a trim
that mis-cuts and then documents its own mistake faithfully.

A CONTROL, run both ways so a green result means something (Session 247). With CLAUDE.md's
shard count corrupted 8 to 5 and one routing clause widened, all nine
docs/architecture-history/*.verify.sh proofs of that day stay GREEN and this module goes RED
on check_composed and check_scan. That is the hole this file exists to close,
measured in both directions rather than asserted.

    found only by asking, per assertion, whether anything exercised it. This
