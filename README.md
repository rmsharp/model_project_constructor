# Model Project Constructor

**Version:** 0.3.0

Multi-agent pipeline that turns a business model idea into a governance-scaffolded GitLab or GitHub project. Given a stakeholder interview, it produces (1) a structured intake report, (2) a data collection plan with validated SQL and a datasheet, and (3) a draft model-build repository with proportional governance artifacts for the claims domain of a property-and-casualty insurer.

The repository, the source tree (`src/model_project_constructor/`) and the import package all use `model_project_constructor`. Only the PyPI distribution names keep hyphens (`model-project-constructor`, `model-project-constructor-data-agent`) — under PEP 503 normalization that is the same name, not a different one.

## Status

Early implementation. Phases and session boundaries are tracked in `SESSION_NOTES.md`; the authoritative design document is `docs/architecture-history/architecture-plan.md` (archived concept-era plan — see `docs/methodology/PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md` §3).

```

Each agent internally uses LangGraph for state management while the top-level orchestrator is a sequential script. The Data Agent is structurally decoupled from `IntakeReport` (constraint C4) so it can be reused standalone by analysts for ad-hoc query generation; it is distributed as a separate installable package `model-project-constructor-data-agent` under `packages/data-agent/` with its own `pyproject.toml`, CLI (`model-data-agent run`), and `USAGE.md`. An AST-based test in `tests/test_data_agent_decoupling.py` enforces the decoupling at CI time.

## Getting started

Prerequisites: `uv` and Python ≥ 3.11.

```bash
uv sync --extra agents --extra ui --extra dev
uv run pytest
```

All 1546 tests should pass (9 more skip without live LLM credentials) with coverage above 95% (currently ≈98.04%). `uv sync` uses a workspace to build and install both `model-project-constructor` and `model-project-constructor-data-agent` editable in one step.

Production deployments read every secret and every deployment-variable parameter from the environment (or from a `.env` file loaded by the caller). See `.env.example` for the full matrix and `OPERATIONS.md` for the runbook. Common failure modes live in `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`; resume a halted run with `scripts/run_pipeline.py --resume <run_id>` (see `OPERATIONS.md` §5).

To skip the web UI extra (and its 32 tests), sync without `ui` and ignore that test directory — the coverage gate needs the full sync, so also drop coverage enforcement:

```bash
uv sync --extra agents --extra dev
uv run pytest --ignore=tests/ui --no-cov
```

To use the standalone Data Agent CLI (requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the environment):

```bash
uv run model-data-agent run --request request.json --output report.json \
    --db-url "sqlite:///claims.db"
```

Add `--fake-llm` for smoke tests that don't hit the real API. Full usage is in `packages/data-agent/USAGE.md`.

To run the Intake Agent against a fixture (headless / CLI mode):

```bash
uv run python -m model_project_constructor.agents.intake \
    --fixture tests/fixtures/subrogation.yaml --output intake.json
```

This drives a synthetic interview via the real LangGraph interrupt/resume loop and writes a validated `IntakeReport` JSON document.

To start the Intake Agent **web UI** (Phase 3B, requires credentials for the selected LLM provider to drive a real interview — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for the default `anthropic`, AWS credentials for `bedrock`, or the `opencode` binary plus its own configuration for `opencode`):

```bash
uv sync --extra agents --extra ui --extra dev
uv run uvicorn model_project_constructor.ui.intake:app --reload
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/`. The UI is a minimal HTMX frontend over the same LangGraph flow used by the CLI; session state is checkpointed to a SQLite file (`intake_sessions.db` by default, override via `INTAKE_DB_PATH`) so interviews survive server restart. The LLM provider/model default to `anthropic` and the provider's own default model; select another backend (any factory provider, e.g. AWS Bedrock-hosted Claude) by exporting `INTAKE_LLM_PROVIDER=bedrock` (and optionally `INTAKE_LLM_MODEL=anthropic.claude-…`) before launch — an unknown provider is rejected at startup. Resume via `GET /sessions/{session_id}`. A server-sent-events endpoint at `/sessions/{session_id}/events` emits the current phase snapshot for scripting/monitoring.

To run the Website Agent against seeded intake + data reports:

```bash
# Fake repo host — no credentials required, writes nothing external.
# Default --host gitlab; emits .gitlab-ci.yml.
uv run python -m model_project_constructor.agents.website \
    --intake tests/fixtures/subrogation_intake.json \
    --data tests/fixtures/sample_datareport.json \
    --fake

# Same fake path, but emit a GitHub Actions CI file instead.
uv run python -m model_project_constructor.agents.website \
    --intake tests/fixtures/subrogation_intake.json \
    --data tests/fixtures/sample_datareport.json \
    --host github \
    --fake

# Real GitLab — creates an actual project via direct httpx calls.
uv run python -m model_project_constructor.agents.website \
    --intake tests/fixtures/subrogation_intake.json \
    --data tests/fixtures/sample_datareport.json \
    --host gitlab \
    --host-url https://gitlab.example.com \
    --namespace data-science/model-drafts \
    --private-token "$GITLAB_TOKEN"

# Real GitHub — creates an actual repo via direct httpx calls. --host-url
# defaults to https://api.github.com; pass an enterprise API URL for GHE.
# Note that GitHub does not support nested namespaces — pass a single
# owner/org.
uv run python -m model_project_constructor.agents.website \
    --intake tests/fixtures/subrogation_intake.json \
    --data tests/fixtures/sample_datareport.json \
    --host github \
    --namespace acme \
    --private-token "$GITHUB_TOKEN"
```

The `--fake` mode prints the full file tree that would be committed and dumps a `RepoProjectResult` JSON payload. `--host` selects the repo-host adapter (`gitlab` or `github`); the chosen host also drives the emitted CI manifest (`.gitlab-ci.yml` for `--host gitlab`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for `--host github`). Pass `--ci-platform {gitlab,github}` to override the CI manifest independently of the repo host (useful for fake-path testing). Phase 4B scaffolds everything in §11 of `docs/architecture-history/architecture-plan.md`, including governance artifacts proportional to `risk_tier` / `cycle_time` per §8.2. Try the tier-1 fixture (`tests/fixtures/tier1_intake.json`) to see the full fan-out including `governance/audit_log/`, `governance/eu_ai_act_compliance.md`, `governance/lcp_integration.md`, and the fairness-audit scaffolds.
